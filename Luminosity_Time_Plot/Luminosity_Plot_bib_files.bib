	abstract = {A classical nova results from runaway thermonuclear explosions on the surface of a white dwarf that accretes matter from a low-mass main-sequence stellar companion. In 2012 and 2013, three novae were detected in $\gamma$ rays and stood in contrast to the first $\gamma$-ray-detected nova V407 Cygni 2010, which belongs to a rare class of symbiotic binary systems. Despite likely differences in the compositions and masses of their white dwarf progenitors, the three classical novae are similarly characterized as soft-spectrum transient $\gamma$-ray sources detected over 2- to 3-week durations. The $\gamma$-ray detections point to unexpected high-energy particle acceleration processes linked to the mass ejection from thermonuclear explosions in an unanticipated class of Galactic $\gamma$-ray sources.},

	abstract = {We present a detailed statistical analysis of the correlation between radio and gamma-ray emission of the active galactic nuclei (AGNs) detected by Fermi during its first year of operation, with the largest data sets ever used for this purpose. We use both archival interferometric 8.4 GHz data (from the Very Large Array and ATCA, for the full sample of 599 sources) and concurrent single-dish 15 GHz measurements from the Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO, for a sub sample of 199 objects). Our unprecedentedly large sample permits us to assess with high accuracy the statistical significance of the correlation, using a surrogate data method designed to simultaneously account for common-distance bias and the effect of a limited dynamical range in the observed quantities. We find that the statistical significance of a positive correlation between the centimeter radio and the broadband (E {\textgreater} 100 MeV) gamma-ray energy flux is very high for the whole AGN sample, with a probability of {\textless}10-7 for the correlation appearing by chance. Using the OVRO data, we find that concurrent data improve the significance of the correlation from 1.6 {\texttimes} 10-6 to 9.0 {\texttimes} 10-8. Our large sample size allows us to study the dependence of correlation strength and significance on specific source types and gamma-ray energy band. We find that the correlation is very significant (chance probability {\textless} 10-7) for both flat spectrum radio quasars and BL Lac objects separately; a dependence of the correlation strength on the considered gamma-ray energy band is also present, but additional data will be necessary to constrain its significance.},

	abstract = {With the upcoming commensal surveys for Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), and their high candidate rate, usage of machine learning algorithms for candidate classification is a necessity. Such algorithms will also play a pivotal role in sending real-time triggers for prompt follow-ups with other instruments. In this paper, we have used the technique of Transfer Learning to train the state-of-the-art deep neural networks for classification of FRB and Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) candidates. These are convolutional neural networks which work on radio frequency-time and dispersion measure-time images as the inputs. We trained these networks using simulated FRBs and real RFI candidates from telescopes at the Green Bank Observatory. We present 11 deep learning models, each with an accuracy and recall above 99.5 per cent on our test data set comprising of real RFI and pulsar candidates. As we demonstrate, these algorithms are telescope and frequency agnostic and are able to detect all FRBs with signal-to-noise ratios above 10 in ASKAP and Parkes data. We also provide an open-source python package FETCH (Fast Extragalactic Transient Candidate Hunter) for classification of candidates, using our models. Using FETCH, these models can be deployed along with any commensal search pipeline for real-time candidate classification.},

	abstract = {We report multiple lines of evidence for a stochastic signal that is correlated among 67 pulsars from the 15 yr pulsar timing data set collected by the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves. The correlations follow the Hellings-Downs pattern expected for a stochastic gravitational-wave background. The presence of such a gravitational-wave background with a power-law spectrum is favored over a model with only independent pulsar noises with a Bayes factor in excess of 1014, and this same model is favored over an uncorrelated common power-law spectrum model with Bayes factors of 200-1000, depending on spectral modeling choices. We have built a statistical background distribution for the latter Bayes factors using a method that removes interpulsar correlations from our data set, finding p = 10-3 (?3$\sigma$) for the observed Bayes factors in the null no-correlation scenario. A frequentist test statistic built directly as a weighted sum of interpulsar correlations yields p = 5 {\texttimes} 10-5 to 1.9 {\texttimes} 10-4 (?3.5$\sigma$-4$\sigma$). Assuming a fiducial f -2/3 characteristic strain spectrum, as appropriate for an ensemble of binary supermassive black hole inspirals, the strain amplitude is \$\{2.4\}\_\{-0.6\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.7\}{\textbackslash}times \{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{-15\}\$ (median + 90\% credible interval) at a reference frequency of 1 yr-1. The inferred gravitational-wave background amplitude and spectrum are consistent with astrophysical expectations for a signal from a population of supermassive black hole binaries, although more exotic cosmological and astrophysical sources cannot be excluded. The observation of Hellings-Downs correlations points to the gravitational-wave origin of this signal.},

	abstract = {The past two decades have seen a major expansion in the availability, size, and precision of time-domain data sets in astronomy. Owing to their unique combination of flexibility, mathematical simplicity, and comparative robustness, Gaussian processes (GPs) have emerged recently as the solution of choice to model stochastic signals in such data sets. In this review, we provide a brief introduction to the emergence of GPs in astronomy, present the underlying mathematical theory, and give practical advice considering the key modeling choices involved in GP regression. We then review applications of GPs to time-domain data sets in the astrophysical literature so far, from exoplanets to active galactic nuclei, showcasing the power and flexibility of the method. We provide worked examples using simulated data, with links to the source code; discuss the problem of computational cost and scalability; and give a snapshot of the current ecosystem of open-source GP software packages. In summary: ?GP regression is a conceptually simple but statistically principled and powerful tool for the analysis of astronomical time series.?It is already widely used in some subfields, such as exoplanets, and gaining traction in many others, such as optical transients.?Driven by further algorithmic and conceptual advances, we expect that GPs will continue to be an important tool for robust and interpretable time-domain astronomy for many years to come.},

	doi = {10.1086/177901},
	abstract = {Two new methods are proposed for linear regression analysis for data with measurement errors. Both methods are designed to accommodate intrinsic scatter in addition to measurement errors. The first method is a direct extension of the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator to allow for measurement errors. It is quite general in that (1) it allows for measurement errors on both variables (2) it permits the measurement errors for the two variables to be dependent, (3) it permits the magnitudes of the measurement errors to depend on the measurements, and (4) other "symmetric" lines such as the bisector and the orthogonal regression can be constructed. We refer to this method as BCES estimators (for bivariate correlated errors and intrinsic scatter). The second method is a weighted least squares (WLS) estimator, which applies only for the case in which the "independent" variable is measured without error and the magnitudes of the measurement errors on the "dependent" variable are independent of the measurements. Several applications are made to extragalactic astronomy: the BCES method, when applied to data describing the color-luminosity relations for field galaxies, yields significantly different slopes than OLS and other estimators used in the literature. Simulations with artificial data sets are used to evaluate the small sample performance of the estimators. Not surprisingly, the least-biased results are obtained when color is treated as the dependent variable. The Tully-Fisher relation is another example for which the BCES method should be used because errors in luminosity and velocity are correlated because of inclination corrections. We also find, via simulations, that the WLS method is by far the best method for the Tolman surface-brightness test, producing the smallest variance in slope by an order of magnitude. Moreover, with WLS it is not necessary to "reduce" galaxies to a fiducial surface-brightness, since this model incorporates intrinsic scatter.},

We show that the outflow was ejected on 2014 August 11-25, in agreement with an independent estimate of the timing of super-Eddington accretion based on the optical, ultraviolet, and X-ray observations, and that the ejected mass corresponds to about 1\%-10\% of the mass accreted in the super-Eddington phase. The temporal evolution of the radio emission also uncovers the circumnuclear density profile, $\rho$ (R){\textbackslash}propto \{R\}-2.5 on a scale of about 0.01 pc, a scale that cannot be probed via direct measurements even in the nearest supermassive black holes. Our discovery of radio emission from the nearest well-studied TDE to date, with a radio luminosity lower than all previous limits, indicates that non-relativistic outflows are ubiquitous in TDEs, and that future, more sensitive, radio surveys will uncover similar events.},

The radio and X-ray data can be jointly explained as the afterglow emission from an SGRB with a jet energy of \~{} \{10\}49\{--\}\{10\}50 erg that exploded in a uniform density environment with n\~{} \{10\}-4\{--\}\{10\}-2 cm-3, viewed at an angle of \~{}20{\textdegree}-40{\textdegree} from the jet axis. Using the results of our light curve and spectral modeling, in conjunction with the inference of the circumbinary density, we predict the emergence of late-time radio emission from the deceleration of the kilonova (KN) ejecta on a timescale of \~{}5-10 years that will remain detectable for decades with next-generation radio facilities, making GW170817 a compelling target for long-term radio monitoring.},

	abstract = {We present radio observations of the tidal disruption event candidate (TDE) XMMSL1 J0740-85 spanning 592 to 875 days post X-ray discovery. We detect radio emission that fades from an initial peak flux density at 1.6 GHz of 1.19 {\textpm} 0.06 mJy to 0.65 {\textpm} 0.06 mJy, suggesting an association with the TDE. This makes XMMSL1 J0740-85 at d = 75 Mpc the nearest TDE with detected radio emission to date and only the fifth TDE with radio emission overall. The observed radio luminosity rules out a powerful relativistic jet like that seen in the relativistic TDE Swift J1644+57. Instead, we infer from an equipartition analysis that the radio emission most likely arises from a non-relativistic outflow similar to that seen in the nearby TDE ASASSN-14li, with a velocity of about 104 km s-1 and a kinetic energy of about 1048 erg, expanding into a medium with a density of about 102 cm-3. Alternatively, the radio emission could arise from a weak initially relativistic but decelerated jet with an energy of \~{} 2{\texttimes} \{10\}50 erg, or (for an extreme disruption geometry) from the unbound debris. The radio data for XMMSL1 J0740-85 continues to support the previous suggestion of a bimodal distribution of common non-relativistic isotropic outflows and rare relativistic jets in TDEs (in analogy with the relation between Type Ib/c supernovae and long-duration gamma-ray bursts). The radio data also provide a new measurement of the circumnuclear density on a sub-parsec scale around an extragalactic supermassive black hole.},

To date, observations reveal a surprisingly diverse population. A small fraction of TDEs (at most a few percent) have been observed to produce radio-luminous mildly relativistic jets. The remainder of the population are radio quiet, producing less luminous jets, non-relativistic outflows or, possibly, no radio emission at all. Here, we review the radio observations that have been made of TDEs to date and discuss possible explanations for their properties, focusing on detected sources and, in particular, on the two best-studied events: Sw J1644+57 and ASASSN-14li. We also discuss what we have learned about the host galaxies of TDEs from radio observations and review constraints on the rates of bright and faint radio outflows in TDEs. Upcoming X-ray, optical, near-IR, and radio surveys will greatly expand the sample of TDEs, and technological advances open the exciting possibility of discovering a sample of TDEs in the radio band unbiased by host galaxy extinction.},

It includes each distinct subdiscipline, including stellar types, progenitors, stellar evolution, nucleosynthesis of elements, supernova types, neutron stars and pulsars, black holes, swept up interstellar matter, cosmic rays, neutrinos from supernovae, supernova observations in different wavelengths, interstellar molecules and dust. While there is a great deal of primary and specialist literature on supernovae, with a great many scientific groups around the world focusing on the phenomenon and related subdisciplines, nothing else presents an overall survey. This handbook closes that gap at last. As a comprehensive and balanced collection that presents the current state of knowledge in the broad field of supernovae, this is to be used as a basis for further work and study by graduate students, astronomers and astrophysicists working in close/related disciplines, and established groups.

	abstract = {Time series analysis techniques, Lomb-Scargle periodogram and weighted wavelet Z-transform, have been employed to search for year-time-scale periodicities from the radio light curves of a typical blazar NRAO 530. The periodicity analysis using the two methods show consistent results: two strong and persistent periods of \~{}10 and \~{}6 yr are prominent at all three wavelengths; three other weaker periodicities with shorter time-scales (\~{}5, \~{}3.5 and \~{}3 yr) were also seen; in addition, the 14.5-GHz WWZ power spectrum revealed a \~{}2-yr periodic component during the time interval 1983-1990. Statistical significance analysis suggests that these periodicities might result from physically periodic process. The characteristic frequencies of these periodicities seem to have a harmonic relationship, and the fundamental frequency, i.e. the first-order harmonic, is about 0.05 yr-1 (P0 = 20 yr). But the fundamental frequency was not pronounced. The multiplicity and apparent harmonic relationship of the periodicities could be interpreted by the global p-mode oscillation of the accretion disc, if the jet and disc are coupled. In this scenario, the periodic fluctuations in the accretion rate consequently lead to the observed periodic variabilities of the radio luminosity.},

	abstract = {We present the discovery of a nuclear transient with the Caltech-NRAO Stripe 82 Survey (CNSS), a dedicated radio transient survey carried out with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). This transient, CNSS J001947.3+003527, exhibited a turn-on over a timescale of ?1 yr, increasing in flux density at 3 GHz from {\textless}0.14 mJy in 2014 February to 4.4 {\textpm} 0.1 mJy in 2015 March, reaching a peak luminosity of \$5{\textbackslash}times \{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{28\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{erg\}{\textbackslash},\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{s\}\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Hz\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ around 2015 October. The association of CNSS J0019+00 with the nucleus (Gaia and our very-long baseline interferometry positions are consistent to within 1 pc) of a nearby S0 Seyfert galaxy at 77 Mpc, together with the radio spectral evolution, implies that this transient is most likely a tidal disruption event (TDE). Our equipartition analysis indicates the presence of a \~{}15,000 km s-1 outflow, having energy \~{}1049 erg. We derive the radial density profile for the circumnuclear material in the host galaxy to be proportional to R-2.5. All of these properties suggest resemblance with radio-detected thermal TDEs like ASASSN-14li and XMMSL1 J0740-85. No significant X-ray or optical emission is detected from CNSS J0019+00, although this may simply be due to the thermal emission being weak during our late-time follow-up observations. From the CNSS survey we have obtained the first unbiased measurement of the rate of radio TDEs, R({\textgreater}500$\mu$Jy) of about 2 {\texttimes} 10-3 deg-2, or equivalently a volumetric rate of about 10 Gpc-3 yr-1. This rate implies that all-sky radio surveys such as the VLA Sky Survey and those planned with ASKAP, will find many tens of radio TDEs over the next few years.},

	abstract = {We present a radio light curve of supernova (SN) 2014C taken with the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager (AMI) Large Array at 15.7 GHz. Optical observations presented by Milisavljevic et al. demonstrated that SN 2014C metamorphosed from a stripped-envelope Type Ib SN into a strongly interacting Type IIn SN within 1 yr. The AMI light curve clearly shows two distinct radio peaks, the second being a factor of 4 times more luminous than the first peak. This double bump morphology indicates two distinct phases of mass-loss from the progenitor star with the transition between density regimes occurring at 100-200 d. This reinforces the interpretation that SN 2014C exploded in a low-density region before encountering a dense hydrogen-rich shell of circumstellar material that was likely ejected by the progenitor prior to the explosion. The AMI flux measurements of the first light-curve bump are the only reported observations taken within \~{}50 to \~{}125 d post-explosion, before the blast-wave encountered the hydrogen shell. Simplistic synchrotron self-absorption and free-free absorption modelling suggest that some physical properties of SN 2014C are consistent with the properties of other Type Ibc and IIn SNe. However, our single frequency data does not allow us to distinguish between these two models, which implies that they are likely too simplistic to describe the complex environment surrounding this event. Lastly, we present the precise radio location of SN 2014C obtained with the electronic Multi-Element Remotely Linked Interferometer Network, which will be useful for future very long baseline interferometry observations of the SN.},

	abstract = {Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are bursts of electromagnetic energy that are released when supermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies violently disrupt a star that passes too close1. TDEs provide a window through which to study accretion onto supermassive black holes; in some rare cases, this accretion leads to launching of a relativistic jet2-9, but the necessary conditions are not fully understood. The best-studied jetted TDE so far is Swift J1644+57, which was discovered in $\gamma$-rays, but was too obscured by dust to be seen at optical wavelengths. Here we report the optical detection of AT2022cmc, a rapidly fading source at cosmological distance (redshift z = 1.19325) the unique light curve of which transitioned into a luminous plateau within days. Observations of a bright counterpart at other wavelengths, including X-ray, submillimetre and radio, supports the interpretation of AT2022cmc as a jetted TDE containing a synchrotron `afterglow', probably launched by a supermassive black hole with spin greater than approximately 0.3. Using four years of Zwicky Transient Facility10 survey data, we calculate a rate of 0.0 2-0.01+0.04 Gpc-3 yr-1 for on-axis jetted TDEs on the basis of the luminous, fast-fading red component, thus providing a measurement complementary to the rates derived from X-ray and radio observations11. Correcting for the beaming angle effects, this rate confirms that approximately 1 per cent of TDEs have relativistic jets. Optical surveys can use AT2022cmc as a prototype to unveil a population of jetted TDEs.},

The pulses are nearly 100\% linearly polarized, show circular polarization up to 12\%, and exhibit variable scattering on timescales of months. The arcsecond-level realfast localization links the source confidently with the Fermi $\gamma$-ray source and places it nearby (though not coincident with) an XMM-Newton X-ray source.

With the addition of flux densities between 150 MHz and 3 GHz from various imaging surveys, we find that up to 40\% of our sample show deviations from a simple power-law model. Using Stokes V measurements from the RACS data, we measured the circular polarization fraction for 9\% of our sample and find that the mean polarization fraction is {\textasciitilde}10\% (consistent between detections and upper limits).

	abstract = {Late-time (\~{}a year) radio follow-up of optically discovered tidal disruption events (TDEs) is increasingly resulting in detections at radio wavelengths, and there is growing evidence for this late-time radio activity to be common to the broad class of subrelativistic TDEs. Detailed studies of some of these TDEs at radio wavelengths are also challenging the existing models for radio emission. Using all-sky multiepoch data from the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), taken as a part of the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS), we searched for radio counterparts to a sample of optically discovered TDEs. We detected late-time emission at RACS frequencies (742{\textendash}1032 MHz) in five TDEs, reporting the independent discovery of radio emission from TDE AT 2019ahk and extending the time baseline out to almost 3000 days for some events. Overall, we find that at least 22-11+15\% of the population of optically discovered TDEs has detectable radio emission in the RACS survey, while also noting that the true fraction can be higher given the limited cadence (two epochs separated by \~{}3 yr) of the survey. Finally, we project that the ongoing higher-cadence (\~{}2 months) ASKAP Variable and Slow Transients survey can detect \~{}20 TDEs in its operational span (4 yr), given the current rate from optical surveys.},

In contrast to almost all alternative theories of gravity2, the strong equivalence principle of general relativity requires universality of free fall to apply even to bodies with strong self-gravity. Direct tests of this principle using Solar System bodies3,4 are limited by the weak self-gravity of the bodies, and tests using pulsar-white-dwarf binaries5,6 have been limited by the weak gravitational pull of the Milky Way. PSR J0337+1715 is a hierarchical system of three stars (a stellar triple system) in which a binary consisting of a millisecond radio pulsar and a white dwarf in a 1.6-day orbit is itself in a 327-day orbit with another white dwarf. This system permits a test that compares how the gravitational pull of the outer white dwarf affects the pulsar, which has strong self-gravity, and the inner white dwarf. Here we report that the accelerations of the pulsar and its nearby white-dwarf companion differ fractionally by no more than 2.6 {\texttimes} 10-6. For a rough comparison, our limit on the strong-field Nordtvedt parameter, which measures violation of the universality of free fall, is a factor of ten smaller than that obtained from (weak-field) Solar System tests3,4 and a factor of almost a thousand smaller than that obtained from other strong-field tests5,6.},

We also detect probable pulsations at the pulsar period (single-trial significance {\textasciitilde}4.5$\sigma$ from an 11(2)\% modulation), which would make this the first system in which both orbital and rotational X-ray pulsations are detected. We interpret the emission as a combination of X-rays from the pulsar itself and from a shock where material overflowing the companion meets the pulsar wind. The similarity of this X-ray emission to that seen from other millisecond pulsar binary systems, in particular 47 Tuc W (PSR J0024 - 7204W) and PSR J1740 - 5340, suggests that they may also undergo disk episodes similar to that seen in J1023 in 2001.},

IPS modulation is rare at low latitudes because of interstellar angular broadening. Second, the source has an extremely steep ({\textasciitilde}v-2) spectrum at decametric wavelengths2. This combination of properties suggested that 4C21.53 was either an undetected pulsar or a member of some new class of objects. This puzzle may be resolved by the discovery and related observations of a fast pulsar, 1937+214, with a period of 1.558 ms in the constellation Vulpecula only a few degrees from the direction to the original pulsar, 1919+21. The existence of such a fast pulsar with no evidence either of a new formation event or of present energy losses raises new questions about the origin and evolution of pulsars.},

	abstract = {DURING an investigation of the short-term behaviour of the radiation coming from pulsars during strong bursts, several objects were found to exhibit pulse nulling phenomena. This was first noted on analogue records of the pulsar radiation intensity where the pen deflexions are a rough measure of the pulse energy. PSR's 0834 + 06, 1133 + 16, 1237 + 25 and 1929 + 10 were found suddenly to miss from one to ten pulses at various times, termed ``nulls'', during otherwise very strong and steady bursts. A null means that the pulse energy decreased by a factor of ten or more over one or two pulse periods and then increased just as sharply after the null. The nulls can be divided into two types according to their duration and their spacing. Type I nulls are the most prominent with a width between three and ten pulses and recur with spacings of about fifty pulses. Type II nulls have a width of only one or two pulses and recur with spacings of three to ten pulses. Pulse sequences from 1133 + 16 and 1237 + 25 and possibly 0834 + 06 contain the Type I nulls while sequences from all four objects contain Type II nulls. A quick look at the spacings of these nulls suggests that they may recur periodically and hence contribute to responses at characteristic periods in pulse energy fluctuation power spectra. This possibility has been reported indirectly by Sutton et al.1 and Hesse2 for the Type II nulls in 0834 + 06 and directly by Lang3 for Type I nulls in 1133 + 16 and 1237 + 25.},

Only three of the transient sources, and none of the variable sources, have been previously identified as transient or variable. Many of our variable sources are suspected scintillating active galactic nuclei. We have identified three variable sources and one transient source that are likely to be associated with star-forming galaxies at z? 0.05, but whose implied luminosity is higher than the most luminous known radio supernova (SN1979C) by an order of magnitude.

	abstract = {Aims: This article shows the first evidence ever of gravitational lensing phenomena in high energy gamma-rays. This evidence comes from the observation of an echo in the light curve of the distant blazar PKS 1830-211 induced by a gravitational lens system. Methods: Traditional methods for estimating time delays in gravitational lensing systems rely on the cross-correlation of the light curves from individual images. We used the 300 MeV-30 GeV photons detected by the Fermi-LAT instrument. It cannot separate the images of known lenses, so the observed light curve is the superposition of individual image light curves. The Fermi-LAT instrument has the advantage of providing long, evenly spaced, time series with very low photon noise. This allows us to use Fourier transform methods directly. Results: A time delay between the two compact images of PKS 1830-211 has been searched for by both the autocorrelation method and the "double power spectrum" method. The double power spectrum shows a 4.2$\sigma$ proof of a time delay of 27.1 {\textpm} 0.6 days, consistent with others' results.},

A clue to the explosion mechanism may lie in the fact that all supernovae that accompany long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) belong to the SN Ic-BL class. Using a combination of two-dimensional relativistic hydrodynamics and radiation transport calculations, we demonstrate that the central engine responsible for long GRBs can also trigger an SN Ic-BL. We find that a reasonable GRB engine injected into a stripped Wolf-Rayet progenitor produces a relativistic jet with energy \~{}1051 erg, as well as an SN whose synthetic light curves and spectra are fully consistent with observed SNe Ic-BL during the photospheric phase. As a result of the jet{\textquoteright}s asymmetric energy injection, the SN spectra and light curves depend on viewing angle. The impact of viewing angle on the spectrum is particularly pronounced at early times, while the viewing-angle dependence for the light curves (\~{}10\% variation in bolometric luminosity) persists throughout the photospheric phase.},

	abstract = {Incoherent dedispersion is a computationally intensive problem that appears frequently in pulsar and transient astronomy. For current and future transient pipelines, dedispersion can dominate the total execution time, meaning its computational speed acts as a constraint on the quality and quantity of science results. It is thus critical that the algorithm be able to take advantage of trends in commodity computing hardware. With this goal in mind, we present an analysis of the 'direct', 'tree' and 'sub-band' dedispersion algorithms with respect to their potential for efficient execution on modern graphics processing units (GPUs). We find all three to be excellent candidates, and proceed to describe implementations in C for CUDA using insight gained from the analysis. Using recent CPU and GPU hardware, the transition to the GPU provides a speed-up of nine times for the direct algorithm when compared to an optimized quad-core CPU code. For realistic recent survey parameters, these speeds are high enough that further optimization is unnecessary to achieve real-time processing. Where further speed-ups are desirable, we find that the tree and sub-band algorithms are able to provide three to seven times better performance at the cost of certain smearing, memory consumption and development time trade-offs. We finish with a discussion of the implications of these results for future transient surveys. Our GPU dedispersion code is publicly available as a C library at .},

This excess resembles remarkably well a signal from dark-matter annihilation. One of the most compelling astrophysical interpretations is that the excess is caused by the combined effect of a previously undetected population of dim $\gamma$ -ray sources. Because of their spectral similarity, the best candidates are millisecond pulsars. Here, we search for this hypothetical source population, using a novel approach based on wavelet decomposition of the $\gamma$ -ray sky and the statistics of Gaussian random fields. Using almost seven years of Fermi-LAT data, we detect a clustering of photons as predicted for the hypothetical population of millisecond pulsar, with a statistical significance of 10.0 $\sigma$ . For plausible values of the luminosity function, this population explains 100\% of the observed excess emission. We argue that other extragalactic or Galactic sources, a mismodeling of Galactic diffuse emission, or the thick-disk population of pulsars are unlikely to account for this observation.},

	abstract = {he burst alert telescope (BAT) is one of three instruments on the Swift MIDEX spacecraft to study gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The BAT first detects the GRB and localizes the burst direction to an accuracy of 1 4 arcmin within 20 s after the start of the event. The GRB trigger initiates an autonomous spacecraft slew to point the two narrow field-of-view (FOV) instruments at the burst location within 20 70 s so to make follow-up X-ray and optical observations. The BAT is a wide-FOV, coded-aperture instrument with a CdZnTe detector plane. The detector plane is composed of 32,768 pieces of CdZnTe (4{\texttimes}4{\texttimes}2 mm), and the coded-aperture mask is composed of \~{}52,000 pieces of lead (5{\texttimes}5{\texttimes}1 mm) with a 1-m separation between mask and detector plane. The BAT operates over the 15 150 keV energy range with \~{}7 keV resolution, a sensitivity of \~{}10-8 erg s-1 cm-2, and a 1.4 sr (half-coded) FOV. We expect to detect {\textgreater} 100 GRBs/year for a 2-year mission. The BAT also performs an all-sky hard X-ray survey with a sensitivity of \~{}2 m Crab (systematic limit) and it serves as a hard X-ray transient monitor.},

	abstract = {The majority of quasars are weak in their radio emission, with flux densities comparable to those in the optical, and energies far lower. A small fraction, about 10\%, are hundreds to thousands of times stronger in the radio. Conventional wisdom holds that there are two classes of quasars, the radio-quiets and radio-louds, with a deficit of sources having intermediate power. Are there really two separate populations, and if so, is the physics of the radio emission fundamentally different between them? This paper addresses the second question, through a study of radio variability across the full range of radio power, from quiet to loud. The VLA was used during 10 epochs to study three carefully selected samples of 11 radio-quiet quasars, 11 radio-intermediate quasars, and 8 radio-loud quasars. A fourth sample consists of 20 VLA calibrators used for phase correction during the observations, all of which are radio-loud. The basic findings are that the root mean square amplitude of variability is independent of radio luminosity or radio-to-optical flux density ratio and that fractionally large variations can occur on timescales of months or less in both radio-quiet and radio-loud quasars. Combining this with similarities in other indicators, such as radio spectral index and the presence of VLBI-scale components, leads to the suggestion that the physics of radio emission in the inner regions of all quasars is essentially the same, involving a compact, partially opaque core together with a beamed jet. It is possible that differences in large-scale radio structures between radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars could stem from disruption of the jets in low-power sources before they can escape their host galaxies.},

For AD Leo, the microwave burst emission was 100 percent right circularly polarized, achieved brightness temperatures near 10 to the 16th K, was generally broadband in character, but was superposed with finite structures in both frequency and time. Quasi-periodic pulsations were clearly present as well as a sudden reduction feature.

On imaging the two temporal sections separately, we detected a point source in the off-pulse images of both the pulsars coincident with the pulsar locations in the on-pulse images. The long periods (3.75 and 1.96 s, respectively) and low spin-down energies ({\textbackslash}dot\{E\} \~{} 10{\textasciicircum}\{31\} erg s-1) of the two pulsars argue against a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) origin for the off-pulse emission. The derived estimates of the interstellar medium particle density required to drive a PWN do not support such an interpretation. A magnetospheric origin for the off-pulse emission raises questions regarding the location of the emission region, which is an important input into pulsar emission models.},

	abstract = {The flux-density spectra of radio pulsars are known to be steep and, to first order, described by a power-law relationship of the form S$\nu$ ? $\nu$$\alpha$, where S$\nu$ is the flux density at some frequency $\nu$ and $\alpha$ is the spectral index. Although measurements of $\alpha$ have been made over the years for several hundred pulsars, a study of the intrinsic distribution of pulsar spectra has not been carried out. From the result of pulsar surveys carried out at three different radio frequencies, we use population synthesis techniques and a likelihood analysis to deduce what underlying spectral index distribution is required to replicate the results of these surveys. We find that in general the results of the surveys can be modelled by a Gaussian distribution of spectral indices with a mean of -1.4 and unit standard deviation. We also consider the impact of the so-called gigahertz-peaked spectrum pulsars proposed by Kijak et al. The fraction of peaked-spectrum sources in the population with any significant turnover at low frequencies appears to be at most 10 per cent. We demonstrate that high-frequency ({\textgreater}2 GHz) surveys preferentially select flatter spectrum pulsars and the converse is true for lower frequency ({\textless}1 GHz) surveys. This implies that any correlations between $\alpha$ and other pulsar parameters (for example age or magnetic field) need to carefully account for selection biases in pulsar surveys. We also expect that many known pulsars which have been detected at high frequencies will have shallow, or positive, spectral indices. The majority of pulsars do not have recorded flux density measurements over a wide frequency range, making it impossible to constrain their spectral shapes. We also suggest that such measurements would allow an improved description of any populations of pulsars with `non-standard' spectra. Further refinements to this picture will soon be possible from the results of surveys with the Green Bank Telescope and LOFAR.},

The driving science objectives of the original design were to observe 21 cm radiation from the Epoch of Reionisation (EoR), explore the radio time domain, perform Galactic and extragalactic surveys, and monitor solar, heliospheric, and ionospheric phenomena. All together 60+ programs recorded 20 000 h producing 146 papers to date. In 2016, the telescope underwent a major upgrade resulting in alternating compact and extended configurations. Other upgrades, including digital back-ends and a rapid-response triggering system, have been developed since the original array was commissioned. In this paper, we review the major results from the prior operation of the MWA and then discuss the new science paths enabled by the improved capabilities. We group these science opportunities by the four original science themes but also include ideas for directions outside these categories.},

	abstract = {The FIRST survey to produce Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty centimeters is now underway using the NRAO Very Large Array. We describe here the scientific motivation for a large-area sky survey at radio frequencies which has a sensitivity and angular resolution comparable to the Palomar Observatory Sky Survey, and we recount the history that led to the current survey project. The technical design of the survey is covered in detail, including a description and justification of the grid pattern chosen, the rationale behind the integration time and angular resolution selected, and a summary of the other considerations which informed our planning for the project. A comprehensive description of the automated data analysis pipeline we have developed is presented. We also report here the results of the first year of FIRST observations. A total of 144 hr of time in 1993 April and May was used for a variety of tests, as well as to cover an initial strip of the survey extending between 07h 15m and 16h 30m in a 2{\textdegree}.8 wide declination zone passing through the local zenith (28.2 {\textless}$\delta$ {\textless} 31.0). A total of 2153 individual pointings yielded an image database containing 1039 merged images 46'.5 {\texttimes} 34'.5 in extent with 1".8 pixels and a typical rms of 0.13 mJy. A catalog derived from this 300 deg2 region contains 28,000 radio sources. We have performed extensive tests on the images and source list in order to establish the photometric and astrometric accuracy of these data products. We find systematic astrometric errors of {\textless} 0".05 individual sources down to the 1 mJy survey flux density threshold have 90\% confidence error circles with radii of {\textless} 1". CLEAN bias introduces a systematic underestimate of point-source flux densities of \~{}0.25 mJy; the bias is more severe for extended sources. Nonetheless, a comparison with a published deep survey field demonstrates that we successfully detect 39/49 sources with integrated flux densities greater than 0.75 mJy, including 19 of 20 sources above 2.0 mJy; the sources not detected are known to be very extended and so have surface brightnesses well below our threshold. With 480 hr of observing time committed for each of the next three B-configuration periods, FIRST will complete nearly one-half of its goal of covering the 10,000 deg2 of the north Galactic cap scheduled for inclusion in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. All of the FIRST data raw visibilities, self-calibrated UV data sets, individual pointing maps, final merged images, source catalogs, and individual source images are being placed in the public domain as soon as they are verified; all of the 1993 data are now available through the NRAO and/or the STScI archive. We conclude with a brief summary of the scientific significance of FIRST, which represents an improvement by a factor of 50 in both angular resolution and sensitivity over the best available large area radio surveys.},

In the majority of sources, we find very low levels of variability with typical modulation indices {\textless}5 per cent. We detect 15 candidate low-frequency variables that show significant long-term variability ({\textgreater}2.8 yr) with time-averaged modulation indices {\textbackslash}overline\{M\}=3.1 - 7.1 per cent. With 7/15 of these variable sources having peaked spectral energy distributions, and only 5.7 per cent of the overall sample having peaked spectra, we find an increase in the prevalence of variability in this spectral class. We conclude that the variability seen in this survey is most probably a consequence of refractive interstellar scintillation and that these objects must have the majority of their flux density contained within angular diameters less than 50 milliarcsec (which we support with multiwavelength data). At 154 MHz, we demonstrate that interstellar scintillation time-scales become long (\~{}decades) and have low modulation indices, while synchrotron-driven variability can only produce dynamic changes on time-scales of hundreds of years, with flux density changes less than one milli-jansky (without relativistic boosting). From this work, we infer that the low-frequency extragalactic southern sky, as seen by SKA-Low, will be non-variable on time-scales shorter than 1 yr.},

	abstract = {Two recent discoveries, namely PSR J0901-4046 and GLEAM-X J162759.5-523504.3 (hereafter GLEAM-X J1627), have corroborated an extant population of radio-loud periodic sources with long periods (76 and 1091 s, respectively) whose emission can hardly be explained by rotation losses. We argue that GLEAM-X J1627 is a highly magnetized object consistent with a magnetar (an ultra-long period magnetar, ULPM), and demonstrate it is unlikely to be either a magnetically or a rotationally powered white dwarf. By studying these sources together with previously detected objects, we find there are at least a handful of promising candidates for Galactic ULPMs. The detections of these objects imply a substantial number, N ? 13 000 and N ? 500 for PSR J0901-4046 like and GLEAM-X J1627 like objects, respectively, within our Galaxy. These source densities, as well as cooling age limits from non-detection of thermal X-rays, Galactic offsets, timing stability and dipole spin-down limits, all imply the ULPM candidates are substantially older than confirmed Galactic magnetars and that their formation channel is a common one. Their existence implies widespread survival of magnetar-like fields for several Myr, distinct from the inferred behaviour in confirmed Galactic magnetars. ULPMs may also constitute a second class of FRB progenitors which could naturally exhibit very long periodic activity windows. Finally, we show that existing radio campaigns are biased against detecting objects like these and discuss strategies for future radio and X-ray surveys to identify more such objects. We estimate that \$\{{\textbackslash}cal O\}(100)\$ more such objects should be detected with SKA-MID and DSA-2000.},

	abstract = {We report on optical, near-infrared, and centimeter radio observations of GRB 000418 that allow us to follow the evolution of the afterglow from 2 to 200 days after the $\gamma$-ray burst (GRB). In modeling these broadband data, we find that an isotropic explosion in a constant-density medium is unable to simultaneously fit both the radio and optical data. However, a jetlike outflow into either a constant density or wind-stratified medium with an opening angle of 10{\textdegree}-20{\textdegree} provides a good description of the data. The evidence in favor of a jet interpretation is based on the behavior of the radio light curves, since the expected jet break is masked at optical wavelengths by the light of the host galaxy. We also find evidence for extinction, presumably arising from within the host galaxy, with AhostV=0.4 mag, as well as host flux densities of FR=1.1 $\mu$Jy and FK=1.7 $\mu$Jy. These values supersede previous work on this burst as a result of the availability of a broadband data set allowing a global fitting approach. A model in which the GRB explodes isotropically into a wind-stratified circumburst medium cannot be ruled out by these data. However, in examining a sample of other bursts (e.g., GRB 990510, GRB 000301C), we favor the jet interpretation for GRB 000418.},

	abstract = {We present radio observations of GRB 980703 at 1.43, 4.86, and 8.46 GHz for the period of 350-1000 days after the burst. These radio data clearly indicate that there is a persistent source at the position of GRB 980703 with a flux density of approximately 70 $\mu$Jy at 1.43 GHz and a spectral index $\beta${\textasciitilde}0.32, where F$\nu${\textasciitilde}$\nu$-$\beta$. We show that emission from the afterglow of GRB 980703 is expected to be 1-2 orders of magnitude fainter and therefore cannot account for these observations. We interpret this persistent emission as coming from the host galaxy-the first example of a $\gamma$-ray burst (GRB) host detection at radio wavelengths. We find that it can be explained as a result of a star formation rate (SFR) of massive stars (M{\textgreater}5 Msolar) of {\textasciitilde}140 Msolar yr-1, which gives a total SFR (0.1 Msolarsolar) of {\textasciitilde}750 Msolar yr-1. On the basis of these data alone we cannot rule out that some fraction of the radio emission originates from an obscured active galactic nucleus. Using the correlation between the radio and far-IR (FIR) luminosities of star-forming galaxies, we find that the host of GRB 980703 is at the faint end of the class of ultraluminous infrared galaxies, with LFIR{\textasciitilde}1012 Lsolar. From the radio measurements of the offset between the burst and the host and of the size of the host, we conclude that GRB 980703 occurred near the center of the galaxy in a region of star formation. A comparison of the properties of this galaxy with radio and optical surveys at a similar redshift (z{\textasciitilde}1) reveals that the host of GRB 980703 is an average radio-selected star-forming galaxy. This result has significant implications for the potential use of a GRB-selected galaxy sample for the study of galaxies and the intergalactic medium at high redshifts, especially using radio observations, which are insensitive to extinction by dust and provide an unbiased estimate of the SFR through the well-known radio-FIR correlation.},

These radio data, in addition to measurements in the optical bands, suggest that the afterglow arises from a collimated outflow, i.e., a jet. To test this hypothesis in a self-consistent manner, we employ a global fit and find that a model of a jet expanding into a constant-density interstellar medium (ISM+jet) provides the best fit to the data. A model of the burst occurring in a wind-shaped circumburst medium (wind-only model) can be ruled out, and a wind+jet model provides a much poorer fit of the optical/IR data than the ISM+jet model. In addition, we present the first clear indication that the reported fluctuations in the optical/IR are achromatic, with similar amplitudes in all bands, and possibly extend into the radio regime. Using the parameters derived from the global fit, in particular a jet break time tjet{\textasciitilde}7.3 days, we infer a jet opening angle of $\theta$0{\textasciitilde}0.2 rad; consequently, the estimate of the emitted energy in the GRB itself is reduced by a factor of 50 relative to the isotropic value, giving E{\textasciitilde}1.1{\texttimes}1051 ergs.},

	abstract = {We present radio observations of GRB 020405 starting 1.2 days after the burst that reveal a rapidly fading ``radio flare.'' Based on its temporal and spectral properties, we interpret the radio flare as emission from the reverse shock. This scenario rules out a circumburst medium with a radial density profile $\rho${\textasciitilde}r-2 expected around a mass-losing massive star since in that case, the reverse-shock emission decays on the timescale of the burst duration t{\textasciitilde}102 s. Using published optical and X-ray data, along with the radio data presented here, we further show that a self-consistent model requires collimated ejecta with an opening angle, $\theta$j{\textasciitilde}6deg (tj{\textasciitilde}0.95 days). As a consequence of the early jet break, the late-time (t{\textgreater}10 days) emission measured with the Hubble Space Telescope significantly deviates from an extrapolation of the early, ground-based data. This, along with an unusually red spectrum, F$\nu${\textasciitilde}$\nu$-3.9, strengthens the case for a supernova that exploded at about the same time as GRB 020405, thus pointing to a massive stellar progenitor for this burst. This is the first clear association of a massive progenitor with a uniform medium, indicating that a $\rho${\textasciitilde}r-2 profile is not a required signature and, in fact, may not be present on the length scales probed by the afterglow in the majority of bursts.},

	abstract = {We present continued radio observations of the tidal disruption event Swift J164449.3+573451 extending to $\delta$t ? 216 days after discovery. The data were obtained with the EVLA, AMI Large Array, CARMA, the SMA, and the VLBA+Effelsberg as part of a long-term program to monitor the expansion and energy scale of the relativistic outflow, and to trace the parsec-scale environment around a previously dormant supermassive black hole (SMBH). The new observations reveal a significant change in the radio evolution starting at $\delta$t ? 1 month, with a brightening at all frequencies that requires an increase in the energy by about an order of magnitude, and an overall density profile around the SMBH of $\rho$vpropr -3/2 (0.1-1.2 pc) with a significant flattening at r ? 0.4-0.6 pc. The increase in energy cannot be explained with continuous injection from an Lvpropt -5/3 tail, which is observed in the X-rays. Instead, we conclude that the relativistic jet was launched with a wide range of Lorentz factors, obeying E({\textgreater} $\Gamma$ j )vprop$\Gamma$-2.5 j . The similar ratios of duration to dynamical timescale for Sw 1644+57 and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) suggest that this result may be applicable to GRB jets as well. The radial density profile may be indicative of Bondi accretion, with the inferred flattening at r {\textasciitilde} 0.5 pc in good agreement with the Bondi radius for a {\textasciitilde}few {\texttimes} 106 M ? black hole. The density at {\textasciitilde}0.5 pc is about a factor of 30 times lower than inferred for the Milky Way Galactic Center, potentially due to a smaller number of mass-shedding massive stars. From our latest observations ($\delta$t ? 216 days) we find that the jet energy is E j, iso ? 5 {\texttimes} 1053 erg (Ej ? 2.4 {\texttimes} 1051 erg for $\theta$ j = 0.1), the radius is r ? 1.2 pc, the Lorentz factor is $\Gamma$ j ? 2.2, the ambient density is n ? 0.2 cm-3, and the projected angular size is r proj ? 25 $\mu$as, below the resolution of the VLBA+Effelsberg. Assuming no future changes in the observed evolution and a final integrated total energy of Ej ? 1052 erg, we predict that the radio emission from Sw 1644+57 should be detectable with the EVLA for several decades and will be resolvable with very long baseline interferometry in a few years.},

	abstract = {Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) display a bimodal duration distribution with a separation between the short- and long-duration bursts at about 2 s. The progenitors of long GRBs have been identified as massive stars based on their association with Type Ic core-collapse supernovae (SNe), their exclusive location in star-forming galaxies, and their strong correlation with bright UV regions within their host galaxies. Short GRBs have long been suspected on theoretical grounds to arise from compact object binary mergers (neutron star-neutron star or neutron star-black hole). The discovery of short GRB afterglows in 2005 provided the first insight into their energy scale and environments, as well as established a cosmological origin, a mix of host-galaxy types, and an absence of associated SNe. In this review, I summarize nearly a decade of short GRB afterglow and host-galaxy observations and use this information to shed light on the nature and properties of their progenitors, the energy scale and collimation of the relativistic outflow, and the properties of the circumburst environments. The preponderance of the evidence points to compact object binary progenitors, although some open questions remain. On the basis of this association, observations of short GRBs and their afterglows can shed light on the on- and off-axis electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational wave sources from the Advanced LIGO/Virgo experiments.},

Using the European VLBI network, we find the source to be compact on VLBI scales with an angular size of {\textless}2.3 mas (3$\sigma$). This corresponds to a transverse physical size of {\textless}9 pc (at the z = 0.241 redshift of the host galaxy), confirming it to be as fast radio burst (FRB) persistent radio source (PRS) like that associated with the first-known repeater FRB 20121102A. The PRS has a flux density of 201 {\textpm} 34 $\mu$Jy at 1.7 GHz and a spectral radio luminosity of L 1.7 GHz = (3.0 {\textpm} 0.5) {\texttimes} 1029 erg s-1 Hz-1 (also similar to the FRB 20121102A PRS). Compared to previous lower-resolution observations, we find that no flux is resolved out on milliarcsecond scales. We have refined the PRS position, improving its precision by an order of magnitude compared to previous results. We also report the detection of the FRB 20190520B burst at 1.4 GHz and find the burst position to be consistent with the PRS position, at ?20 mas. This strongly supports their direct physical association and the hypothesis that a single central engine powers both the bursts and the PRS. We discuss the model of a magnetar in a wind nebula and present an allowed parameter space for its age and the radius of the putative nebula powering the observed PRS emission. Alternatively, we find that an accretion-powered hypernebula model also fits our observational constraints.},

From simulating radio light curves incorporating realistic external variability in image A, we find time delays consistent at 1$\sigma$ for all frequencies and in total flux density and polarization. The delay with the smallest uncertainty (total flux density at 8.5 GHz) is \$42.3{\textasciicircum}\{+2.0\}\_\{-1.8\}\$ (random) {\textpm}0.5 (systematic) d (equivalent to 42.3 {\textpm} 2.1 d) whereas combining all delay estimates gives a slightly higher value of 43.6 {\textpm} 1.2 d. Both values are lower than the previously published radio result and inconsistent with that found in the optical. H0 determination is difficult due to the complicated lensing mass and the lack of constraints provided by only two images. However, analysis of archival Very Long Baseline Interferometry data reveals jets in this system for the first time, the orientations of which provide model constraints. In addition, extremely sensitive maps made from combining all the monitoring data reveal faint emission on one side of the lensing galaxy that we speculate might be the result of a naked-cusp lensing configuration. Finally, we find clear evidence for external variability in image A on time-scales of days to years, the frequency dependence of which supports the previous conclusion that this is predominantly due to microlensing. External variability seems to be completely absent in image B and this does not appear to be a consequence of scatter-broadening in the interstellar medium of the lensing galaxy.},

The 8.4- and 15-GHz variability curves show significant variability, especially in polarization, but lack features on short time-scales that would be necessary for an accurate measurement of the very short predicted time delays (\${\textbackslash}lesssim\$1 d) between the three bright images. Time delays can only realistically be measured to the very faint image D and for the first time we detect its long-term variability and determine its polarization properties. However, image-dependent (extrinsic) variability (including variations on time-scales of hours) is present in multiple images and the magnitude of this is largest in image D at 15 GHz ({\textpm}10 per cent). As the variations appear to increase in amplitude with frequency, we suggest that the most likely cause is microlensing by compact objects in the lensing galaxy. Combining the monitoring data allows us to detect a faint arc of emission lying between images B and C and the jets responsible for this are imaged using archival VLBA data.

	abstract = {Variability of radio-emitting active galactic nuclei can be used to probe both intrinsic variations arising from shocks, flares, and other changes in emission from regions surrounding the central supermassive black hole, as well as extrinsic variations due to scattering by structures in our own Galaxy. Such interstellar scattering also probes the structure of the emitting regions, with microarcsecond resolution. Current studies have necessarily been limited to either small numbers of objects monitored over long periods of time, or large numbers of objects but with poor time sampling. The dramatic increase in survey speed engendered by the Square Kilometre Array will enable precision synoptic monitoring studies of hundreds of thousands of sources with a cadence of days or less. Statistics of variability, in particular concurrent observations at multiple radio frequencies and in other bands of the electromagnetic spectrum, will probe accretion physics over a wide range of AGN classes, luminosities, and orientations, as well as enabling a detailed understanding of the structures responsible for radio wave scattering in the Galactic interstellar medium.},

	abstract = {The nuclei of most normal galaxies contain supermassive black holes, which can accrete gas through a disk and become active. These active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can form jets that are observed on scales from astronomical units to megaparsecs and from meter wavelengths to TeV energies. High-resolution radio imaging and multiwavelength/messenger campaigns are elucidating the conditions under which this happens. Evidence is presented that: Relativistic AGN jets are formed when the black hole spins and the the accretion disk is strongly magnetized, perhaps on account of gas accreting at high latitude beyond the black hole sphere of influence. AGN jets are collimated close to the black hole by magnetic stress associated with a disk wind. Higher-power jets can emerge from their galactic nuclei in a relativistic, supersonic, and proton-dominated state, and they terminate in strong, hot spot shocks; lower-power jets are degraded to buoyant plumes and bubbles. Jets may accelerate protons to EeV energies, which contribute to the cosmic ray spectrum and may initiate pair cascades that can efficiently radiate synchrotron $\gamma$-rays. Jets were far more common when the Universe was a few billion years old and black holes and massive galaxies were growing rapidly. Jets can have a major influence on their environments, stimulating and limiting the growth of galaxies.The observational prospects for securing our understanding of AGN jets are bright.},

Their phenomenal luminosity -- several billion times that of the sun -- has motivated their use as cosmological distance indicators and led to the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the universe. SNe Ia are also the main producers of iron and hence play a fundamental role in the chemical evolution of galaxies. While recent observations have confirmed the basic theoretical picture of an exploding C-O WD star whose luminosity is powered by the radioactive decay of \${\textasciicircum}\{56\}\$Ni, a number of uncertainties remain concerning the nature of the binary companion and the explosion mechanism. Several lines of evidence point towards the existence of multiple progenitor channels in order to explain the full range of the observed diversity. A complete physical understanding of these energetic stellar explosions remains a long-lasting goal of modern astrophysics.},

Although the high-energy transient Sw 1644+57 initially displayed none of the theoretically anticipated (nor previously observed) TDF characteristics, we show that observations suggest a sudden accretion event onto a central MBH of mass about 106 to 107 solar masses. There is evidence for a mildly relativistic outflow, jet collimation, and a spectrum characterized by synchrotron and inverse Compton processes; this leads to a natural analogy of Sw 1644+57 to a temporary smaller-scale blazar.},

A class of neutron stars known as magnetars is a leading candidate source of FRBs3,4. Magnetars have surface magnetic fields in excess of 1014 gauss, the decay of which powers a range of high-energy phenomena5. Here we report observations of a millisecond-duration radio burst from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154, with a fluence of 1.5 {\textpm} 0.3 megajansky milliseconds. This event, FRB 200428 (ST 200428A), was detected on 28 April 2020 by the STARE2 radio array6 in the 1,281-1,468 megahertz band. The isotropic-equivalent energy released in FRB 200428 is 4 {\texttimes} 103 times greater than that of any radio pulse from the Crab pulsar{\textemdash}previously the source of the brightest Galactic radio bursts observed on similar timescales7. FRB 200428 is just 30 times less energetic than the weakest extragalactic FRB observed so far8, and is drawn from the same population as the observed FRB sample. The coincidence of FRB 200428 with an X-ray burst9-11 favours emission models that describe synchrotron masers or electromagnetic pulses powered by magnetar bursts and giant flares3,4,12,13. The discovery of FRB 200428 implies that active magnetars such as SGR 1935+2154 can produce FRBs at extragalactic distances.},

The optical spectrum resembles that of a magnetic (AM Herculis or DQ Herculis type) CV. Five nights of optical CCD photometry showed variations on timescales of minutes to hours, along with rapid flickering. A reexamination of the FIRST radio-survey data reveals that the radio detection was based on a single 6.6 mJy flare; on two other occasions, the source was below the {\textasciitilde}1 mJy survey limit. Several other magnetic CVs are known to be variable radio sources, suggesting that FIRST J1023+0038 is a new member of this class (and the first CV to be discovered on the basis of radio emission). However, FIRST J1023+0038 is several optical magnitudes fainter than the other radio-detected magnetic CVs. It remains unclear whether the source simply had a very rare and extraordinarily intense radio flare at the time of the FIRST observation, or is really an unusually radio-luminous CV; thus, further observations are urged.},

The radio observations were carried out between 9 and 22 years after the initial X-ray discovery, and thus probe the late-time formation of relativistic jets and jet interactions with the interstellar medium in these systems. We detect a compact radio source in the nucleus of the galaxy IC 3599 and a compact radio source that is a possible counterpart to RX J1420.4+5334. We find no radio counterparts for five other sources with flux density upper limits between 51 and 200 $\mu$Jy (3$\sigma$). If the detections truly represent late radio emission associated with a TDE, then our results suggest that a fraction, {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 10\%, of X-ray-detected TDEs are accompanied by relativistic jets. We explore several models for producing late radio emission, including interaction of the jet with gas in the circumnuclear environment (blast wave model), and emission from the core of the jet itself. Upper limits on the radio flux density from archival observations suggest that the jet formation may have been delayed for years after the TDE, possibly triggered by the accretion rate dropping below a critical threshold of {\textasciitilde}10-2-10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\} {\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\_\{Edd\}. The non-detections are also consistent with this scenario; deeper radio observations can determine whether relativistic jets are present in these systems. The emission from RX J1420.4+5334 is also consistent with the predictions of the blast wave model; however, the radio emission from IC 3599 is substantially underluminous, and its spectral slope is too flat, relative to the blast wave model expectations. Future radio monitoring of IC 3599 and RX J1420.4+5334 will help to better constrain the nature of the jets in these systems.},

We introduce the rotation measure transfer function (RMTF), which is an excellent predictor of n$\pi$ ambiguity problems with the $\lambda$2 coverage. Rotation measure synthesis can be implemented very efficiently on modern computers. Because the analysis is easily applied to wide fields, one can conduct very fast RM surveys of weak spatially extended sources. Difficult situations, for example multiple sources along the line of sight, are easily detected and transparently handled. Under certain conditions, it is even possible to recover the emission as a function of Faraday depth within a single cloud of ionized gas. Rotation measure synthesis has already been successful in discovering widespread, weak, polarized emission associated with the Perseus cluster (de Bruyn \& Brentjens 2005, A\&A, 441, 931). In simple, high signal to noise situations it is as good as traditional linear fits to $\chi$ versus $\lambda$2 plots. However, when the situation is more complex or very weak polarized emission at high rotation measures is expected, it is the only viable option.},

AT 2020xnd belongs to the category of optically luminous FBOTs with similarities to the archetypal event AT 2018cow. AT 2020xnd shows luminous radio emission reaching L $\nu$ ? 8 {\texttimes} 1029 erg s-1 Hz-1 at 20 GHz and 75 days post-explosion, accompanied by luminous and rapidly fading soft X-ray emission peaking at L X ? 6 {\texttimes} 1042 erg s-1. Interpreting the radio emission in the context of synchrotron radiation from the explosion's shock interaction with the environment, we find that AT 2020xnd launched a high-velocity outflow (v {\textasciitilde} 0.1c-0.2c) propagating into a dense circumstellar medium (effective \${\textbackslash}dot\{M\}{\textbackslash}approx \{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}{\textbackslash},\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ yr-1 for an assumed wind velocity of v w = 1000 km s-1). Similar to AT 2018cow, the detected X-ray emission is in excess compared to the extrapolated synchrotron spectrum and constitutes a different emission component, possibly powered by accretion onto a newly formed black hole or neutron star. These properties make AT 2020xnd a high-redshift analog to AT 2018cow, and establish AT 2020xnd as the fourth member of the class of optically luminous FBOTs with luminous multiwavelength counterparts.},

As part of a larger imaging project to characterize the variable and transient sky at radio frequencies {\textless}200 MHz, we have blindly detected the redback system PSR J2215+5135 as a variable source of interest with the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR). Using observations with cadences of two weeks - six months, we find preliminary evidence that the eclipse duration is frequency dependent (?$\nu$-0.4), such that the pulsar is eclipsed for longer at lower frequencies, in broad agreement with beamformed studies of other similar sources. Furthermore, the detection of the eclipses in imaging data suggests an eclipsing medium that absorbs the pulsed emission, rather than scattering it. Our study is also a demonstration of the prospects of finding pulsars in wide-field imaging surveys with the current generation of low-frequency radio telescopes.},

	abstract = {Low-luminosity gamma-ray bursts (ll-GRBs) constitute a subclass of GRBs that play a central role in the GRB-supernova connection. While ll-GRBs differ from typical long GRBs (LGRBs) in many aspects, they also share some common features. Therefore, the question whether the gamma-ray emission of ll-GRBs and LGRBs has a common origin is of great interest. Here we address this question by testing whether ll-GRBs, like LGRBs according to the Collapsar model, can be generated by relativistic jets that punch holes in the envelopes of their progenitor stars. The Collapsar model predicts that the durations of most observed bursts will be comparable to, or longer than, the time it takes the jets to break out of the star. We calculate the jet breakout times of ll-GRBs and compare them to the observed durations. We find that there is a significant excess of ll-GRBs with durations that are much shorter than the jet breakout time and that these are inconsistent with the Collapsar model. We conclude that the processes that dominate the gamma-ray emission of ll-GRBs and of LGRBs are most likely fundamentally different.},

Following previous indications of a candidate PRS associated with FRB20240114A, we performed deep VLBA observations at 5 GHz to test the presence of a compact radio source within the uncertainty position of this FRB (\${\textbackslash}pm\$200 mas). We detect a component \${\textbackslash}sim\$50 mas northwards the nominal position provided by the PRECISE collaboration. The corresponding radio luminosity, together with the Faraday rotation measure provided by previous observations of the FRB, locate this PRS in the expected region of the \$L\$ vs {\textbar}RM{\textbar} relation for the nebular model, further supporting it. The comparison of the measured flux density with the values collected at lower frequency by previous studies indicates a possible steepening of the radio spectrum in the 1-5 GHz range.

	abstract = {Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration, bright (approximately Jy) extragalactic bursts, whose production mechanism is still unclear1. Recently, two repeating FRBs were found to have a physically associated persistent radio source of non-thermal origin2,3. These two FRBs have unusually large Faraday rotation measure values2,3, probably tracing a dense magneto-ionic medium, consistent with synchrotron radiation originating from a nebula surrounding the FRB source4{\textendash}8. Recent theoretical arguments predict that, if the observed Faraday rotation measure mostly arises from the persistent radio source region, there should be a simple relation between the persistent radio source luminosity and the rotation measure itself7,9. Here we report the detection of a third, less luminous persistent radio source associated with the repeating FRB source FRB 20201124A at a distance of 413 Mpc, substantially expanding the predicted relation into the low luminosity{\textendash}low Faraday rotation measure regime ({\textless}1,000 rad m-2). At lower values of the Faraday rotation measure, the expected radio luminosity falls below the limit-of-detection threshold for present-day radio telescopes. These findings support the idea that the persistent radio sources observed so far are generated by a nebula in the FRB environment and that FRBs with low Faraday rotation measure may not show a persistent radio source because of a weaker magneto-ionic medium. This is generally consistent with models invoking a young magnetar as the central engine of the FRB, in which the surrounding ionized nebula{\textemdash}or the interacting shock in a binary system{\textemdash}powers the persistent radio source.},

	abstract = {A study is made of the implications of the recent polarization measurements for the structures of discrete radio sources and the source-observer media. Simple models of wavelength-dependent depolarizing mechanisms are investigated and it is found that most are incompatible with the observations of Gardner \& whiteoak. The models of internal Faraday dispersion predict a lower polarization at 30 cm than is observed. It is suggested that the depolarization of the Crab nebula is produced by Faraday rotation in the filamentary shell that surrounds the nebula. Such filaments could also exist in the outer regions of extragalactic sources. A complex number representation is used for the state of linear polarization and a Faraday dispersion function is defined to describe the distribution of polarized radiation with respect to Faraday depth. The persistence of polarization at 30 cm, after partial depolarization between 10 cm and zo an, implies that the radiation is spread over a large range of Faraday depths. The observed linearity of the plot of the angle of polarization against wavelength squared for most sources implies that it is justifiable to make an assumption which enables one to calculate the Faraday dispersion function of a source from the dependence of its polarization on wavelength. Estimates are given for upper limits to the densities of internal ionized gases in the sources for which we have polarization measurements.},

We present the discovery of an ultra-long-period radio-emitting neutron star, PSR J0901-4046, with spin properties distinct from the known spin- and magnetic-decay-powered neutron stars. With a spin period of 75.88 s, a characteristic age of 5.3 Myr and a narrow pulse duty cycle, it is uncertain how its radio emission is generated and challenges our current understanding of how these systems evolve. The radio emission has unique spectro-temporal properties, such as quasi-periodicity and partial nulling, that provide important clues to the emission mechanism. Detecting similar sources is observationally challenging, which implies a larger undetected population. Our discovery establishes the existence of ultra-long-period neutron stars, suggesting a possible connection to the evolution of highly magnetized neutron stars, ultra-long-period magnetars and fast radio bursts.},

The first two states have been observed to progressively evolve over the course of 8 months with the quenched state interspersed between them suggesting physical changes in the region producing the emission. A constraint on the radius of the source for the observed period rules out an isolated magnetic white-dwarf origin. Unlike other long-period sources, ASKAP 1935+2148 shows marked variations in emission modes reminiscent of neutron stars.

Using the extensive multiwavelength data set available in Bo{\"o}tes and detailed modelling of the far-infrared to ultraviolet spectral energy distribution (SED), we are able to separate the star formation (N = 758) and the AGN (N = 784) dominated populations. We study the shape of the radio SEDs and their evolution across cosmic time and find significant differences in the spectral curvature between the SF galaxy and AGN populations. While the radio spectra of SF galaxies exhibit a weak but statistically significant flattening, AGN SEDs show a clear trend to become steeper towards lower frequencies. No evolution of the spectral curvature as a function of redshift is found for SF galaxies or AGNs. We investigate the redshift evolution of the infrared-radio correlation for SF galaxies and find that the ratio of total infrared to 1.4-GHz radio luminosities decreases with increasing redshift: q1.4 GHz = (2.45 {\textpm} 0.04) (1 + z)-0.15 {\textpm} 0.03. Similarly, q150 MHz shows a redshift evolution following q150 GHz = (1.72 {\textpm} 0.04) (1 + z)-0.22 {\textpm} 0.05. Calibration of the 150 MHz radio luminosity as a star formation rate tracer suggests that a single power-law extrapolation from q1.4 GHz is not an accurate approximation at all redshifts.},

	abstract = {The dense stellar environment of the Galactic center has been proposed to host a large population of as-yet undetected millisecond pulsars (MSPs). Recently, this hypothesis has found support in an analysis of gamma-rays detected using the Large Area Telescope onboard the Fermi satellite, which revealed an excess of diffuse GeV photons in the inner 15 deg about the Galactic center. The excess can be interpreted as the collective emission of thousands of MSPs in the Galactic bulge, with a spherical distribution strongly peaked toward the Galactic center. In order to fully establish the MSP interpretation, it is essential to find corroborating evidence in multi-wavelength searches, most notably through the detection of radio pulsations from individual bulge MSPs. Based on globular cluster observations and gamma-ray emission from the inner Galaxy, we investigate the prospects for detecting MSPs in the Galactic bulge. While previous pulsar surveys failed to identify this population, we demonstrate that upcoming large-area surveys of this region should lead to the detection of dozens of bulge MSPs. Additionally, we show that deep targeted searches of unassociated Fermi sources should be able to detect the first few MSPs in the bulge. The prospects for these deep searches are enhanced by a tentative gamma-ray/radio correlation that we infer from high-latitude gamma-ray MSPs. Such detections would constitute the first clear discoveries of field MSPs in the Galactic bulge, with far-reaching implications for gamma-ray observations, the formation history of the central Milky Way, and strategy optimization for future deep radio pulsar surveys.},

On 27 December 2004, a giant flare with a fluence exceeding 0.3ergcm-2 was detected from SGR 1806-20. Here we report the detection of a fading radio counterpart to this event. We began a monitoring programme from 0.2 to 250GHz and obtained a high-resolution 21-cm radio spectrum that traces the intervening interstellar neutral hydrogen clouds. Analysis of the spectrum yields the first direct distance measurement of SGR 1806 - 20: the source is located at a distance greater than 6.4kpc and we argue that it is nearer than 9.8kpc. If correct, our distance estimate lowers the total energy of the explosion and relaxes the demands on theoretical models. The energetics and the rapid decay of the radio source are not compatible with the afterglow model that is usually invoked for $\gamma$-ray bursts. Instead, we suggest that the rapidly decaying radio emission arises from the debris ejected during the explosion.},

The torque experienced by the neutron star during this period, as inferred from a measurement of its rotational frequency derivative, decreased by 60\%, although not in a steady manner. We have also observed very large ongoing fluctuations in flux density and pulse shape. Superimposed on these, a general diminution of flux density and a broadening of the pulse profile components occurred nearly contemporaneously with a decrease in torque of about 10\% that took place in late 2006 July over an interval of 2 weeks. After a slight increase in average flux density, since 2006 October the flux density has continued to decline and the pulse profiles, while still varying, appear more uniform. In addition, a simultaneous observation of the pulsar with the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the Green Bank Telescope allows us to show how the X-ray and radio profiles are aligned. We discuss briefly the implications of these results for the magnetospheric currents in this remarkable object.},

	abstract = {Anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs) are slowly rotating neutron stars with very bright and highly variable X-ray emission that are believed to be powered by ultra-strong magnetic fields of {\textgreater}1014 G, according to the `magnetar' model. The radio pulsations that have been observed from more than 1,700 neutron stars with weaker magnetic fields have never been detected from any of the dozen known magnetars. The X-ray pulsar XTE J1810 - 197 was revealed (in 2003) as the first AXP with transient emission when its luminosity increased 100-fold from the quiescent level; a coincident radio source of unknown origin was detected one year later. Here we show that XTE J1810 - 197 emits bright, narrow, highly linearly polarized radio pulses, observed at every rotation, thereby establishing that magnetars can be radio pulsars. There is no evidence of radio emission before the 2003 X-ray outburst (unlike ordinary pulsars, which emit radio pulses all the time), and the flux varies from day to day. The flux at all radio frequencies is approximately equal-and at {\textgreater}20GHz XTE J1810 - 197 is currently the brightest neutron star known. These observations link magnetars to ordinary radio pulsars, rule out alternative accretion models for AXPs, and provide a new window into the coronae of magnetars.},

The analysis is from the point of view of an observer, with much of the emphasis placed on how observations, and the modelling of observations, have constrained what we known about GRB-SNe. We discuss their photometric and spectroscopic properties, their role as cosmological probes, including their measured luminosity\$-\$decline relationships, and how they can be used to measure the Hubble constant. We present a statistical analysis of their bolometric properties, and use this to determine the properties of the "average" GRB-SNe: which has a kinetic energy of \$E\_\{{\textbackslash}rm K\} {\textbackslash}approx 2.5{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{52\}\$ erg, an ejecta mass of \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm ej\} {\textbackslash}approx 6\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, a nickel mass of \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm Ni\} {\textbackslash}approx 0.4\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, a peak photospheric velocity of \$v\_\{{\textbackslash}rm ph\} {\textbackslash}approx 21,000\$ km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, a peak bolometric luminosity of \$L\_\{{\textbackslash}rm p\} {\textbackslash}approx 1{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{43\}\$ erg s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, and it reaches peak bolometric light in \$t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm p\} {\textbackslash}approx 13\$ days. We discuss their geometry, consider the various physical processes that are thought to power the luminosity of GRB-SNe, and whether differences exist between GRB-SNe and the SNe associated with ultra-long duration GRBs. We discuss how observations of the environments of GRB-SNe further constrain the physical properties of their progenitor stars, and give an overview of the current theoretical paradigms of their suspected central engines. We also present an overview of the radioactively powered transients that have been photometrically associated with short-duration GRBs. We conclude the review by discussing what additional research is needed to further our understanding of GRB-SNe, in particular the role of binary-formation channels and the connection of GRB-SNe with superluminous SNe (abridged).},

	abstract = {We present late-time radio/millimeter (as well as optical/UV and X-ray) detections of tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2018hyz, spanning 970-1300 d after optical discovery. In conjunction with earlier deeper limits, including those at ?700 days, our observations reveal rapidly rising emission at 0.8-240 GHz, steeper than F $\nu$ ? t 5 relative to the time of optical discovery. Such a steep rise cannot be explained in any reasonable scenario of an outflow launched at the time of disruption (e.g., off-axis jet, sudden increase in the ambient density), and instead points to a delayed launch. Our multifrequency data allow us to directly determine the radius and energy of the radio-emitting outflow, and we find from our modeling that the outflow was launched ?750 days after optical discovery. The outflow velocity is mildly relativistic, with $\beta$ ? 0.25 and ?0.6 for a spherical geometry and a 10{\textdegree} jet geometry, respectively, and the minimum kinetic energy is E K ? 5.8 {\texttimes} 1049 and ?6.3 {\texttimes} 1049 erg, respectively. This is the first definitive evidence for the production of a delayed mildly relativistic outflow in a TDE; a comparison to the recently published radio light curve of ASASSN-15oi suggests that the final rebrightening observed in that event (at a single frequency and time) may be due to a similar outflow with a comparable velocity and energy. Finally, we note that the energy and velocity of the delayed outflow in AT2018hyz are intermediate between those of past nonrelativistic TDEs (e.g., ASASSN-14li, AT2019dsg) and the relativistic TDE Sw J1644+57. We suggest that such delayed outflows may be common in TDEs.},

Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), and spanning 55-560 days post disruption. We find that the peak brightness of the radio emission increases until {\textasciitilde}200 days and subsequently begins to decrease steadily. Using a standard equipartition analysis, including the effects of synchrotron cooling as determined by the joint VLA-ALMA spectral energy distributions, we find that the outflow powering the radio emission is in roughly free expansion with a velocity of ?0.07 c, while its kinetic energy increases by a factor of about 5 from 55 to 200 days and plateaus at ?4.4 {\texttimes} 1048 erg thereafter. The ambient density traced by the outflow declines as radius ?R-1.7 on a scale of ?(1-4) {\texttimes} 1016 cm (?6300-25,000 Rs), followed by a steeper decline to ?7 {\texttimes} 1016 cm (?44,000 Rs). Allowing for a collimated geometry, we find that to reach even mildly relativistic velocities ($\Gamma$ = 2) the outflow requires an opening angle of $\theta$j ? 2{\textdegree}, which is narrow even by the standards of gamma-ray burst jets; a truly relativistic outflow requires an unphysically narrow jet. The outflow velocity and kinetic energy in AT2019dsg are typical of previous non-relativistic TDEs, and comparable to those from type Ib/c supernovae, raising doubts about the claimed association with a high-energy neutrino event.},

With its wide spectral bandpass, extending to GeV energies, Fermi is sensitive to GRBs with very large isotropic energy releases (1054 erg). Although rare, these events are particularly important for testing GRB central-engine models. When combined with spectroscopic redshifts, our afterglow data for these four events are able to constrain jet collimation angles, the density structure of the circumburst medium, and both the true radiated energy release and the kinetic energy of the outflows. In agreement with our earlier work, we find that the relativistic energy budget of at least one of these events (GRB 090926A) exceeds the canonical value of 1051 erg by an order of magnitude. Such energies pose a severe challenge for models in which the GRB is powered by a magnetar or a neutrino-driven collapsar, but remain compatible with theoretical expectations for magnetohydrodynamical collapsar models (e.g., the Blandford-Znajek mechanism). Our jet opening angles ($\theta$) are similar to those found for pre-Fermi GRBs, but the large initial Lorentz factors ($\Gamma$0) inferred from the detection of GeV photons imply $\theta$$\Gamma$0 ? 70-90, values which are above those predicted in magnetohydrodynamic models of jet acceleration. Finally, we find that these Fermi-LAT events preferentially occur in a low-density circumburst environment, and we speculate that this might result from the lower mass-loss rates of their lower-metallicity progenitor stars. Future studies of Fermi-LAT afterglows at radio wavelengths with the order-of-magnitude improvement in sensitivity offered by the Extended Very Large Array should definitively establish the relativistic energy budgets of these events.},

The $\gamma$-ray light curve is marked by a soft precursor pulse some 200 s before the main event; the lack of any intervening emission suggests that it is due to a physical mechanism distinct from the GRB itself. The large time lag between the precursor and the main emission enabled simultaneous observations in the $\gamma$-ray, X-ray, and optical bandpasses, something only achieved for a handful of events to date. While the contemporaneous X-rays are the low-energy tail of the prompt emission, the optical does not directly track the $\gamma$-ray flux. Instead, the early-time optical data appear consistent with the forward shock synchrotron peak passing through the optical and are therefore likely the beginning of the afterglow. On hour timescales after the burst, the X-ray and optical light curves are inconsistent with an adiabatic expansion of the shock into the surrounding region, but rather indicate that there is a period of energy injection. Observations at late times allow us to constrain the collimation angle of the relativistic outflow to 6.8d{\textless}{\textasciitilde}$\theta${\textless}{\textasciitilde}9.3d. Our estimates of both the kinetic energy of the afterglow (EKE=5.2+7.9-4.1{\texttimes}1051 ergs) and the prompt $\gamma$-ray energy release (E$\gamma$=7.5+6.7-2.4{\texttimes}1051 ergs) make GRB 050820A one of the most energetic events for which such values could be determined.},

Our multi-wavelength follow-up campaign uncovered a long-lived (duration {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} months), luminous X-ray (L X, iso ? 3 {\texttimes} 1047 erg s-1) and radio ($\nu$L $\nu$, iso ? 1042 erg s-1) counterpart. The associated optical emission, however, from which we measure a redshift of 1.1853, is relatively faint, and this is not due to a large amount of dust extinction in the host galaxy. Based on numerous similarities with the recently discovered GRB 110328A/Swift J164449.3+573451 (Sw J1644+57), we suggest that Sw J2058+05 may be the second member of a new class of relativistic outbursts resulting from the tidal disruption of a star by a supermassive black hole. If so, the relative rarity of these sources (compared with the expected rate of tidal disruptions) implies that either these outflows are extremely narrowly collimated ($\theta$ {\textless} 1{\textdegree}) or only a small fraction of tidal disruptions generate relativistic ejecta. Analogous to the case of long-duration gamma-ray bursts and core-collapse supernovae, we speculate that rapid spin of the black hole may be a necessary condition to generate the relativistic component. Alternatively, if powered by gas accretion (i.e., an active galactic nucleus (AGN)), Sw J2058+05 would seem to represent a new mode of variability in these sources, as the observed properties appear largely inconsistent with known classes of AGNs capable of generating relativistic jets (blazars, narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies).},

The observations commenced less than 35 h after its registered first outburst. We obtained timing, polarization, and spectral information. Swift J1818.0-1607 has an unusually steep spectrum for a radio emitting magnetar and also has a relatively narrow and simple pulse profile. The position angle swing of the polarization is flat over the pulse profile, possibly suggesting that our line of sight grazes the edge of the emission beam. This may also explain the steep spectrum. The spin evolution shows large variation in the spin-down rate, associated with four distinct timing events over the course of our observations. Those events may be related to the appearance and disappearance of a second pulse component. The first timing event coincides with our actual observations, while we did not detect significant changes in the emission properties that could reveal further magnetospheric changes. Characteristic ages inferred from the timing measurements over the course of months vary by nearly an order of magnitude. A longer-term spin-down measurement over approximately 100 d suggests a characteristic age of about 500 yr, larger than previously reported. Though Swift J1818.0-1607 could still be one of the youngest neutron stars (and magnetars) detected so far, we caution using the characteristic age as a true-age indicator given the caveats behind its calculation.},

	abstract = {In a supernova explosion, the ejecta interacting with the surrounding circumstellar medium (CSM) give rise to variety of radiation. Since CSM is created from the mass loss from the progenitor, it carries footprints of the late time evolution of the star. This is one of the unique ways to get a handle on the nature of the progenitor system. Here, I will focus mainly on the supernovae (SNe) exploding in dense environments, a.k.a. Type IIn SNe. Radio and X-ray emission from this class of SNe have revealed important modifications in their radiation properties, due to the presence of high density CSM. Forward shock dominance in the X-ray emission, internal free-free absorption of the radio emission, episodic or non-steady mass loss rate, and asymmetry in the explosion seem to be common properties of this class of SNe.},

	abstract = {We present a comprehensive multiwavelength analysis of the bright, long-duration gamma-ray burst GRB 070125, comprised of observations in gamma-ray, X-ray, optical, millimeter, and centimeter wave bands. Simultaneous fits to the optical and X-ray light curves favor a break on day 3.78, which we interpret as the jet break from a collimated outflow. Independent fits to optical and X-ray bands give similar results in the optical bands but shift the jet break to around day 10 in the X-ray light curve. We show that for the physical parameters derived for GRB 070125, inverse Compton scattering effects are important throughout the afterglow evolution. While inverse Compton scattering does not affect radio and optical bands, it may be a promising candidate to delay the jet break in the X-ray band. Radio light curves show rapid flux variations, which are interpreted as due to interstellar scintillation and used to derive an upper limit of 2.4 {\texttimes} 1017 cm on the radius of the fireball in the lateral expansion phase of the jet. Radio light curves and spectra suggest a high synchrotron self-absorption frequency indicative of the afterglow shock wave moving in a dense medium. Our broadband modeling favors a constant density profile for the circumburst medium over a windlike profile (R-2). However, keeping in mind the uncertainty of the parameters, it is difficult to unambiguously distinguish between the two density profiles. Our broadband fits suggest that GRB 070125 is a burst with high radiative efficiency ({\textgreater}60\%).},

	abstract = {We report on the discovery of radio afterglow emission from the gamma-ray burst GRB 090423, which exploded at a redshift of 8.3, making it the object with the highest known redshift in the universe. By combining our radio measurements with existing X-ray and infrared observations, we estimate the kinetic energy of the afterglow, the geometry of the outflow, and the density of the circumburst medium. Our best-fit model suggests a quasi-spherical, high-energy explosion in a low, constant-density medium. GRB 090423 had a similar energy release to the other well-studied high redshift GRB 050904 (z = 6.26), but their circumburst densities differ by 2 orders of magnitude. We compare the properties of GRB 090423 with a sample of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) at moderate redshifts. We find that the high energy and afterglow properties of GRB 090423 are not sufficiently different from other GRBs to suggest a different kind of progenitor, such as a Population III (Pop III) star. However, we argue that it is not clear that the afterglow properties alone can provide convincing identification of Pop III progenitors. We suggest that the millimeter and centimeter radio detections of GRB 090423 at early times contained emission from the reverse shock. If true, this may have important implications for the detection of high-redshift GRBs by the next generation of radio facilities.},

Our sample of 304 afterglows consists of 2995 flux density measurements (including upper limits) at frequencies between 0.6 GHz and 660 GHz, with the majority of data taken at 8.5 GHz frequency band (1539 measurements). We use this data set to carry out a statistical analysis of the radio-selected sample. The detection rate of radio afterglows has stayed unchanged almost at 31\% before and after the launch of the Swift satellite. The canonical long-duration GRB radio light curve at 8.5 GHz peaks at three to six days in the source rest frame, with a median peak luminosity of 1031 erg s-1 Hz-1. The peak radio luminosities for short-hard bursts, X-ray flashes, and the supernova-GRB classes are an order of magnitude or more fainter than this value. There are clear relationships between the detectability of a radio afterglow and the fluence or energy of a GRB, and the X-ray or optical brightness of the afterglow. However, we find few significant correlations between these same GRB and afterglow properties and the peak radio flux density. We also produce synthetic light curves at centimeter and millimeter bands using a range of blast wave and microphysics parameters derived from multiwavelength afterglow modeling, and we use them to compare to the radio sample. Finding agreement, we extrapolate this behavior to predict the centimeter and millimeter behavior of GRBs observed by the Expanded Very Large Array and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array.},

	abstract = {Fast radio bursts are astronomical radio flashes of unknown physical nature with durations of milliseconds. Their dispersive arrival times suggest an extragalactic origin and imply radio luminosities that are orders of magnitude larger than those of all known short-duration radio transients. So far all fast radio bursts have been detected with large single-dish telescopes with arcminute localizations, and attempts to identify their counterparts (source or host galaxy) have relied on the contemporaneous variability of field sources or the presence of peculiar field stars or galaxies. These attempts have not resulted in an unambiguous association with a host or multi-wavelength counterpart. Here we report the subarcsecond localization of the fast radio burst FRB 121102, the only known repeating burst source, using high-time-resolution radio interferometric observations that directly image the bursts. Our precise localization reveals that FRB 121102 originates within 100 milliarcseconds of a faint 180-microJansky persistent radio source with a continuum spectrum that is consistent with non-thermal emission, and a faint (twenty-fifth magnitude) optical counterpart. The flux density of the persistent radio source varies by around ten per cent on day timescales, and very long baseline radio interferometry yields an angular size of less than 1.7 milliarcseconds. Our observations are inconsistent with the fast radio burst having a Galactic origin or its source being located within a prominent star-forming galaxy. Instead, the source appears to be co-located with a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus or a previously unknown type of extragalactic source. Localization and identification of a host or counterpart has been essential to understanding the origins and physics of other kinds of transient events, including gamma-ray bursts and tidal disruption events. However, if other fast radio bursts have similarly faint radio and optical counterparts, our findings imply that direct subarcsecond localizations may be the only way to provide reliable associations.},

We propose a radiative diffusion in a time-dependent outflow model to interpret such special transients. In this model, we assume that a central engine ejects continuous outflow during a few days. We consider the ejection of the outflow to be time-dependent. The outflow is optically thick initially and photons are frozen in it. As the outflow expands over time, photons gradually escape, and our work is to model such an evolution. Numerical and analytical calculations are considered separately, and the results are consistent. We apply the model to three typical FBOTs: PS1-10bjp, ZTF18abukavn, and ATLAS19dqr. The modeling finds the total mass of the outflow ({\textasciitilde}1-5 M ?), and the total time of the ejection ({\textasciitilde}a few days) for them, leading us to speculate that they may be the result of the collapse of massive stars.},

If the gas is the ambient interstellar medium, the observations suggest that gas of this density is fairly pervasive. If the gas is circumstellar, there are important implications for the progenitors of Type I supernovae. A plausible density distribution for circumstellar gas is rho varies inversely as the square of r. The expansion of a supernova into such a medium is examined and is compared with expansion into a uniform medium. The two cases can be distinghuished on the basis of their density profiles and their rates of expansion. Currently available data favor the hypothesis of expansion in a uniform medium for all three Type I remnants; the evidence is the strongest for SN 1572 and the weakest for SN 1604. Further X-ray and radio observations of the galactic remnants and of extragalactic Type I supernovae should serve to test this hypothesis.},

The instability can drive turbulent motions, and these, it is thought, may amplify the magnetic field and accelerate relativistic electrons.

	abstract = {The radio emission from supernovae has been modeled as synchrotron emission from the interaction between the supernova and a presupernova stellar wind. The emission shows a late power-law decline and early rise due to a low-frequency absorption process, which, in some cases (SN 1979C and SN 1980K), is well modeled as free-free absorption by the external wind. However, the flux rises in many radio supernovae (e.g., SN 1987A and Type Ib and Type Ic supernovae) have not been sufficiently well observed to define the absorption mechanism. The assumption of synchrotron self-absorption yields an approximate radius of the emission region at the time of peak flux. If another mechanism is dominant, the radius must be even larger. The large radii implied for SN 1987A and the observed Type Ib and Type Ic supernovae make external free-free absorption unlikely, given what else is known about these systems, so that synchrotron self-absorption is the probable absorption mechanism. Synchrotron self-absorption may play a role in the radio emission from SN 1981K (type unknown) and SN 1978K (Type IIn). Model supernova light curves with synchrotron self-absorption are presented. A combination of synchrotron self-absorption and external free-free absorption may be relevant to SN 1993J. The radii implied for the Type II supernovae SN 1979C and SN 1980K in the synchrotron self-absorption model are smaller than the radii expected for circumstellar interaction and are thus consistent with the free-free absorption mechanism.},

In addition, it provides an opportunity to understand the shock physics connected to both thermal and nonthermal processes, including relativistic particle acceleration, radiation processes, and the hydrodynamics of shock waves. This chapter has an emphasis on the information we can get from radio and X-ray observations, but also their connection to observations in the optical and ultraviolet. We first review the different physical processes involved in circumstellar interaction, including hydrodynamics, thermal X-ray emission, acceleration of relativistic particles, and non-emission processes in the radio and X-ray ranges. Finally, we discuss applications of these to different types of supernovae.},

	abstract = {Beginning with the $\gamma$-ray bursts GRB 970228 and GRB 970508, a standard model for the interpretation of gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows emerged involving synchrotron emission from a constant-energy blast wave expanding into a constant-density, ``interstellar'' medium. However, a massive star origin for GRBs implies a stellar wind environment, probably a Wolf-Rayet star, and we have previously suggested wind interaction models for the afterglows of GRBs 980326, 980519, and 980425/SN 1998bw. Here, we extend the theory of afterglows in winds, considering strong cooling phases, the transition to nonrelativistic motion, jets, and prompt reverse-shock emission. We find that, compared to the interstellar case, the optical prompt emission in the wind case could have a comparable magnitude but would die off faster. We examine the afterglows of other well-observed GRBs in the context of wind interaction models and find that GRBs 970228 and 970508 are likely wind interactors. The revision in the nonthermal afterglow emission from GRB 970228 caused by the recognition of late supernova emission favors wind interaction. The radio evolution of GRB 970508 provides especially strong evidence for wind interaction. For GRB 970508, the observations suggest a density that is compatible with that expected in a Wolf-Rayet star wind. Finally, observations of the afterglow evolution of GRBs 990123 and 990510 and the prompt optical emission from GRB 990123 favor interstellar interaction models, which would suggest compact star merger progenitors for these objects.},

	abstract = {We report the first astrophysical application of the technique of wide-field interplanetary scintillation (IPS) with the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). This powerful technique allows us to identify and measure sub-arcsecond compact components in low-frequency radio sources across large areas of sky without the need for long-baseline interferometry or ionospheric calibration. We present the results of a 5-min observation of a 30 {\texttimes} 30 deg2 MWA field at 162 MHz with 0.5 s time resolution. Of the 2550 continuum sources detected in this field, 302 (12 per cent) show rapid fluctuations caused by IPS. We find that at least 32 per cent of bright low-frequency radio sources contain a sub-arcsecond compact component that contributes over 40 per cent of the total flux density. Perhaps surprisingly, peaked-spectrum radio sources are the dominant population among the strongly scintillating, low-frequency sources in our sample. While gamma-ray active galactic nuclei are generally compact, flat-spectrum radio sources at higher frequencies (162 MHz), the properties of many of the Fermi blazars in our field are consistent with a compact component embedded within more extended low-frequency emission. The detection of a known pulsar in our field shows that the wide-field IPS technique is at the threshold of sensitivity needed to detect new pulsars using image plane analysis, and scaling the current MWA sensitivity to that expected for SKA-low implies that large IPS-based pulsar searches will be feasible with SKA. Calibration strategies for the SKA require a better knowledge of the space density of compact sources at low radio frequencies, which IPS observations can now provide.},

We have developed the methodology to derive these counts directly from the IPS observables, while taking into account changes in sensitivity across the survey area. The counts of sources with compact structure follow the behaviour of the dominant source population above \~{}3 Jy but below this they show Euclidean behaviour. We compare our counts to those predicted by simulations and find a good agreement for our counts of sources with compact structure, but significant disagreement for point source counts. Using low radio frequency spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from the Galactic and Extragalactic MWA survey, we classify point sources as compact steep spectrum (CSS), flat spectrum, or peaked. If we consider the CSS sources to be the more evolved counterparts of the peaked sources, the two categories combined comprise approximately 80 per cent of the point source population. We calculate densities of potential calibrators brighter than 0.4 Jy at low frequencies and find 0.2 sources per square degrees for point sources, rising to 0.7 sources per square degree if sources with more complex arcsecond structure are included. We extrapolate to estimate 4.6 sources per square degrees at 0.04 Jy. We find that a peaked spectrum is an excellent predictor for compactness at low frequencies, increasing the number of good calibrators by a factor of three compared to the usual flat spectrum criterion.},

	abstract = {The recurrent nova T Pyx underwent its sixth historical outburst in 2011, and became the subject of an intensive multi-wavelength observational campaign. We analyze data from the Swift and Suzaku satellites to produce a detailed X-ray light curve augmented by epochs of spectral information. X-ray observations yield mostly non-detections in the first four months of outburst, but both a super-soft and hard X-ray component rise rapidly after Day 115. The super-soft X-ray component, attributable to the photosphere of the nuclear-burning white dwarf, is relatively cool ({\textasciitilde}45 eV) and implies that the white dwarf in T Pyx is significantly below the Chandrasekhar mass ({\textasciitilde}1 M ?). The late turn-on time of the super-soft component yields a large nova ejecta mass (gsim 10-5 M ?), consistent with estimates at other wavelengths. The hard X-ray component is well fit by a {\textasciitilde}1 keV thermal plasma, and is attributed to shocks internal to the 2011 nova ejecta. The presence of a strong oxygen line in this thermal plasma on Day 194 requires a significantly super-solar abundance of oxygen and implies that the ejecta are polluted by white dwarf material. The X-ray light curve can be explained by a dual-phase ejection, with a significant delay between the first and second ejection phases, and the second ejection finally released two months after outburst. A delayed ejection is consistent with optical and radio observations of T Pyx, but the physical mechanism producing such a delay remains a mystery.},

Our targets display a striking diversity in their optical parameters (e.g., spanning optical fading timescales, t 2 = 1-263 days), and we find a similar diversity in the radio light curves. Using a brightness temperature analysis, we find that radio emission from novae is a mixture of thermal and synchrotron emission, with nonthermal emission observed at earlier times. We identify high brightness temperature emission (T B {\textgreater} 5 {\texttimes} 104 K) as an indication of synchrotron emission in at least nine (25\%) of the novae. We find a class of synchrotron-dominated novae with mildly evolved companions, exemplified by V5589 Sgr and V392 Per, that appear to be a bridge between classical novae with dwarf companions and symbiotic binaries with giant companions. Four of the novae in our sample have two distinct radio maxima (the first dominated by synchrotron and the later by thermal emission), and in four cases the early synchrotron peak is temporally coincident with a dramatic dip in the optical light curve, hinting at a common site for particle acceleration and dust formation. We publish the light curves in a machine-readable table and encourage the use of these data by the broader community in multiwavelength studies and modeling efforts.},

Our data place direct constraints on the density of the surrounding medium at radii {\textasciitilde}1015-1016 cm, implying an upper limit on the mass loss rate from the progenitor system of {\textbackslash}dot\{M\} {\textbackslash}lesssim 6{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-10\}{\textbackslash} \{\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}{\textbackslash} yr{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\} (assuming a wind speed of 100 km s-1) or expansion into a uniform medium with density n CSM {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 6 cm-3. Drawing from the observed properties of non-conservative mass transfer among accreting white dwarfs, we use these limits on the density of the immediate environs to exclude a phase space of possible progenitor systems for SN 2011fe. We rule out a symbiotic progenitor system and also a system characterized by high accretion rate onto the white dwarf that is expected to give rise to optically thick accretion winds. Assuming that a small fraction, 1\%, of the mass accreted is lost from the progenitor system, we also eliminate much of the potential progenitor parameter space for white dwarfs hosting recurrent novae or undergoing stable nuclear burning. Therefore, we rule out much of the parameter space associated with popular single degenerate progenitor models for SN 2011fe, leaving a limited phase space largely inhabited by some double degenerate systems, as well as exotic single degenerates with a sufficient time delay between mass accretion and SN explosion.},

	abstract = {We survey our understanding of classical novae-nonterminal, thermonuclear eruptions on the surfaces of white dwarfs in binary systems. The recent and unexpected discovery of GeV gamma rays from Galactic novae has highlighted the complexity of novae and their value as laboratories for studying shocks and particle acceleration. We review half a century of nova literature through this new lens, and conclude the following: The basics of the thermonuclear runaway theory of novae are confirmed by observations. The white dwarf sustains surface nuclear burning for some time after runaway, and until recently, it was commonly believed that radiation from this nuclear burning solely determines the nova's bolometric luminosity. The processes by which novae eject material from the binary system remain poorly understood. Mass loss from novae is complex (sometimes fluctuating in rate, velocity, and morphology) and often prolonged in time over weeks, months, or years. The complexity of the mass ejection leads to gamma-ray-producing shocks internal to the nova ejecta. When gamma rays are detected (around optical maximum), the shocks are deeply embedded and the surrounding gas is very dense. Observations of correlated optical and gamma-ray light curves confirm that the shocks are radiative and contribute significantly to the bolometric luminosity of novae. Novae are therefore the closest and most common interaction-powered transients.},

	abstract = {Context. Luminous fast blue optical transients (LFBOTs) are a class of extragalactic transients notable for their rapid rise and fade times, blue colour, and accompanying luminous X-ray and radio emission. Only a handful have been studied in detail since the prototypical example AT 2018cow. Their origins are currently unknown, but ongoing observations of previous and new events are placing ever stronger constraints on their progenitors. Aims. We aim to put further constraints on the LFBOT AT 2023fhn, and LFBOTs as a class, using information from the multi-wavelength transient light curve, its host galaxy, and local environment. Methods. Our primary results were obtained by fitting galaxy models to the spectral energy distribution of AT 2023fhn's host and local environment, and by modelling the radio light curve of AT 2023fhn as due to synchrotron self-absorbed emission from an expanding blast wave in the circumstellar medium. Results. We find that neither the host galaxy nor circumstellar environment of AT 2023fhn are unusual compared with previous LFBOTs, but that AT 2023fhn has a much lower X-ray to ultraviolet luminosity ratio than previous events. Conclusions. We argue that the variety in ultraviolet-optical to X-ray luminosity ratios among LFBOTs is likely due to viewing angle differences, and that the diffuse, yet young local environment of AT 2023fhn {\textendash} combined with a similar circumstellar medium to previous events {\textendash} favours a progenitor system containing a massive star with strong winds. Plausible progenitor models in this interpretation therefore include the mergers of black holes and Wolf-Rayet stars or failed supernovae.},

	abstract = {We present the geometrical optics for refraction of a distant background radio source by an interstellar plasma lens, with specific application to a lens with a Gaussian profile of free-electron column density. The refractive properties of the lens are specified completely by a dimensionless parameter $\alpha$, which is a function of the wavelength of observation, the free-electron column density through the lens, the lens-observer distance, and the diameter of the lens transverse to the line of sight. A lens passing between the observer and a background source, due to the relative motions of the observer, lens, and source, produces modulations in the light curve of the background source. Because plasma lenses are diverging, the light curve displays a minimum in the background source's flux density, formed when the lens is on-axis, surrounded by enhancements above the nominal (unlensed) flux density. The exact form of the light curve depends only upon the parameter $\alpha$ and the relative angular sizes of the source and lens as seen by the observer. Other effects due to lensing include the following: (1) the formation of caustic surfaces, upon which the apparent brightness of the background source becomes very large; (2) the possible creation of multiple images of the background source; and (3) angular position wander of the background source. If caustics are formed, the separation of the outer caustics can be used to constrain $\alpha$, while the separation of the inner caustics can constrain the size of the lens. We apply our analysis to two sources, which have undergone extreme scattering events: (1) 0954+658, a source for which we can identify multiple caustics in its light curve, and (2) 1741-038, for which polarization observations were obtained during and after the scattering event. We find general agreement between modeled and observed light curves at 2.25 GHz, but poor agreement at 8.1 GHz. The discrepancies between the modeled and observed light curves may result from some combination of substructure within the lens, an anisotropic lens shape, a lens which only grazes the source rather than passing completely over it, or unresolved substructure within the extragalactic sources. Our analysis also allows us to place constraints on the physical characteristics of the lens. The inferred properties of the lens responsible for the scattering event toward 0954+658 (1741-038) are that it was 0.38 AU (0.065 AU) in diameter with a peak column density of 0.24 pc cm-3 (10-4 pc cm-3), an electron density within the lens of 105 cm-3 (300 cm-3), and a mass of 6.5 {\texttimes} 10-14 M? (10-18 M?). The angular position wander caused by the lens was 250 mas (0.4 mas) at 2.25 GHz. In the case of 1741-038, we can place an upper limit of only 100 mG on the magnetic field within the lens.},

	abstract = {LARGE fluctuations in the radio emissions from the quasar 0954 + 658 (ref. 1) attest to the existence of large-scale inhomogeneities in the ionized interstellar medium. These fluctuations, termed extreme scattering events, are caused by the refractive focusing of the radio waves by discrete plasma structures. In principle, the radio emissions of pulsars should also be a sensitive probe of such phenomena2-5, which should be manifest as fluctuations in the flux density and increased delays in the timing measurements. Here we report the detection of an extreme scattering event, lasting about 15 days, in timing observations of the millisecond pulsar 1937 + 21. This event provides independent evidence for the existence of large-scale structure in the interstellar medium, and allows us to constrain the properties of the lensing structure (distance, velocity, linear dimension and electron density) more tightly than has been possible from detections of lensed extragalactic radio sources. Of more practical importance, such events could be the dominant source of timing noise in millisecond pulsars at {\textasciitilde}1 GHz, and will need to be considered when searching for the subtle signature of gravitational waves in pulsar timing measurements.},

It starts from first principles in order to fill gaps in students' backgrounds, make teaching easier for professors who are not expert radio astronomers, and provide a useful reference to the essential equations used by practitioners.This unique textbook reflects the fact that students of multiwavelength astronomy typically can afford to spend only one semester studying the observational techniques particular to each wavelength band. Essential Radio Astronomy presents only the most crucial concepts - succinctly and accessibly. It covers the general principles behind radio telescopes, receivers, and digital backends without getting bogged down in engineering details. Emphasizing the physical processes in radio sources, the book's approach is shaped by the view that radio astrophysics owes more to thermodynamics than electromagnetism.Proven in the classroom and generously illustrated throughout, Essential Radio Astronomy is an invaluable resource for students and researchers alike.},

Radio sources produced by starbursts have brightness temperatures Tb?105 K above $\nu$\~{}1 GHz, and they become optically thick to free-free absorption when Tb is significantly higher than the typical electron temperature Te\~{}104 K in H ii regions. Compact sources produced by monsters remain transparent until synchrotron self-absorption occurs at Tb?mec2/k\~{}1010 K. Only monsters can make radio sources with relativistic outflows, well-collimated jets, lobe emission well outside the galaxy of stars, or morphological evidence for precession. Almost all galaxies obeying the very tight FIR/radio luminosity correlation are starbursts, and radio sources in galaxies with significantly lower (or higher) than average FIR/radio ratios are powered by monsters. The rare nonthermal FIR sources in blazars are very compact and can be distinguished by their smooth radio/FIR spectra. Any thermal FIR source heated by a single monster must be moderately compact (r?1 kpc at $\lambda$\~{}10 $\mu$m), while the diffuse radiation field in a dusty starburst can produce more extended FIR emission. The most compact (r\~{}100 pc) ultraluminous [log(L/L?)>=11.25] starbursts are embedded in dust opaque even at $\lambda$\~{}25 $\mu$m, so their broad line regions are probably extended and cannot be ionized by monsters. Their FIR sources have nearly blackbody spectra and 25-60 $\mu$m spectral indices $\alpha$IR?+1.5. Thus warmer ($\alpha$IR{\textless}+1.5) FIR sources are heated by monsters exclusively. Useful complete samples of nearby active galaxies have recently been selected at radio and FIR wavelengths and classified as either starbursts or monsters.},

	abstract = {Motivated by the recent detection of ultralong-period radio transients, we investigate new models of coherent radio emission via low-altitude electron-positron pair production in neutron stars (NSs) beyond rotationally powered curvature radiation deathlines. We find that plastic motion (akin to 'continental drift') and qualitatively similar thermoelectric action by temperature gradients in the crusts of slowly rotating, highly magnetized NSs could impart mild local magnetospheric twists. Regardless of which mechanism drives twists, we find that particle acceleration initiates pair cascades across charge-starved gaps above a mild critical twist. Cascades are initiated via resonant inverse-Compton scattered photons or curvature radiation, and may produce broad-band coherent radio emission. We compute the pair luminosity (maximum allowed radio luminosity) for these two channels, and derive deathlines and 'active zones' in \$P-{\textbackslash}dot\{P\}\$ space from a variety of considerations. We find these twist-initiated pair cascades only occur for magnetar-like field strengths \$B rsim 10{\textasciicircum}\{14\}\$ G and long periods: \$P\_\{{\textbackslash}rm RICS\} rsim 120 {\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}, (T/10{\textasciicircum}\{6.5\} \{{\textbackslash}rm K\}){\textasciicircum}\{-5\} {\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm s\}\$ and \$P\_\{{\textbackslash}rm curv\} rsim 150 {\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}, (\{{\textbackslash}rm v\_\{{\textbackslash}rm pl\}\}/10{\textasciicircum}\{3\} \{{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}rm cm {\textbackslash}, yr{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}){\textasciicircum}\{-7/6\} {\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm s\}\$. Using a simplified geometric model, we find that plastic motion or thermoelectrically driven twists might naturally reproduce the observed luminosities, time-scales, and timing signatures. We further derive 'active zones' in which rotationally powered pair creation occurs via resonantly scattered photons, beyond standard curvature deathlines for pulsars. All cascades are generically accompanied by simultaneous (non-)thermal X-ray/UV counterparts which might be detectable with current instrumentation.},

CSS161010 shows luminous X-ray (LX \~{} 5 {\texttimes} 1039 erg s-1) and radio (L$\nu$ \~{} 1029 erg s-1 Hz-1) emission. The radio emission peaked at \~{}100 days post-transient explosion and rapidly decayed. We interpret these observations in the context of synchrotron emission from an expanding blast wave. CSS161010 launched a mildly relativistic outflow with velocity $\Gamma$$\beta$c >= 0.55c at \~{}100 days. This is faster than the non-relativistic AT 2018cow ($\Gamma$$\beta$c \~{} 0.1c) and closer to ZTF18abvkwla ($\Gamma$$\beta$c >= 0.3c at 63 days). The inferred initial kinetic energy of CSS161010 (Ek ? 1051 erg) is comparable to that of long gamma-ray bursts, but the ejecta mass that is coupled to the mildly relativistic outflow is significantly larger ( \${\textbackslash}sim 0.01{\textbackslash}mbox\{--\}0.1{\textbackslash},\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ ). This is consistent with the lack of observed $\gamma$-rays. The luminous X-rays were produced by a different emission component to the synchrotron radio emission. CSS161010 is located at \~{}150 Mpc in a dwarf galaxy with stellar mass M* \~{} 107 M? and specific star formation rate sSFR \~{} 0.3 Gyr-1. This mass is among the lowest inferred for host galaxies of explosive transients from massive stars. Our observations of CSS161010 are consistent with an engine-driven aspherical explosion from a rare evolutionary path of a H-rich stellar progenitor, but we cannot rule out a stellar tidal disruption event on a centrally located intermediate-mass black hole. Regardless of the physical mechanism, CSS161010 establishes the existence of a new class of rare (rate {\textless} 0.4\% of the local core-collapse supernova rate) H-rich transients that can launch mildly relativistic outflows.},

We survey FRB phenomenology, source models and host galaxies, coherent radiation models, and the role of plasma propagation effects in burst detection. The FRB field is guaranteed to be exciting: New telescopes will expand the sample from the current \~{}80 unique burst sources (and only a few secure localizations and redshifts) to thousands, with burst localizations that enable host-galaxy redshifts emerging directly from interferometric surveys. FRBs are now established as an extragalactic phenomenon. Only a few sources are known to repeat. Despite the failure to redetect other FRBs, they are not inconsistent with all being repeaters. FRB sources may be new, exotic kinds of objects or known types in extreme circumstances. Many inventive models exist, ranging from alien spacecraft to cosmic strings, but those concerning compact objects and supermassive black holes have gained the most attention. A rapidly rotating magnetar is a promising explanation for FRB 121102 along with the persistent source associated with it, but alternative source models are not ruled out for it or other FRBs. FRBs are powerful tracers of circumsource environments, {\textquotedblleft}missing baryons{\textquotedblright} in the intergalactic medium (IGM), and dark matter. The relative contributions of host galaxies and the IGM to propagation effects have yet to be disentangled, so dispersion measure distances have large uncertainties.},

For most lines of sight through the Galaxy, spectral broadening due to scattering below about 0.1 Hz at 1 GHz occurs. Spectral broadening is therefore unimportant for the detection of hypothesized signals from extraterrestrial intelligence. Intensity scintillations, however, are of considerable importance. They both help and hinder detection: signals too weak to be detected without the scattering medium may be modulated above the detection threshold while, conversely, signals above threshold can be modulated below. In strong scattering (distances above about 100 pc at 1 GHz), multiple observations of a given target comprise a strategy that is superior to single observations even when the total time per target is held fixed. Decoding information carrying signals may encounter difficulties due to intensity scintillations.},

This work builds upon and supercedes the Taylor \& Cordes (1993) model by exploiting new observations and analysis methods. For lines of sight directed out of the Galactic plane, the new model yields substantially larger values for pulsar dispersion measures, except for directions dominated by the local hot bubble. Unlike the TC93 model, the new model provides sufficient electrons to account for the dispersion measures of the vast majority of known, Galactic pulsars. The new model is described and exemplified using plots of astronomically useful quantities on Galactic-coordinate grids. Software available on the Internet is also described.

It cannot be explained by any observational selection effect and most plausibly is due to a relationship between a neutron star's magnetic moment and the momentum impulse given to it at or near the time of its formation. A small fraction of the objects are discrepant with respect to the velocity-PP(dot) relation. For some objects, this discrepancy may be evidence for a peculiar evolutionary history.},

	abstract = {The dividing line between gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and ordinary stripped-envelope core-collapse supernovae (SNe) is yet to be fully understood. Observationally mapping the variety of ejecta outcomes (ultrarelativistic, mildly relativistic, or nonrelativistic) in SNe of Type Ic with broad lines (Ic-BL) can provide a key test to stellar explosion models. However, this requires large samples of the rare SN Ic-BL events with follow-up observations in the radio, where fast ejecta can be probed largely free of geometry and viewing angle effects. Here, we present the results of a radio (and X-ray) follow-up campaign of 16 SNe Ic-BL detected by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). Our radio campaign resulted in four counterpart detections and 12 deep upper limits. None of the events in our sample is as relativistic as SN 1998bw and we constrain the fraction of SN 1998bw-like explosions to {\textless}19\% (3$\sigma$ Gaussian equivalent), a factor of ?2 smaller than previously established. We exclude relativistic ejecta with radio luminosity densities in between ?5 {\texttimes} 1027 erg s-1 Hz-1 and ?1029 erg s-1 Hz-1 at t ? 20 days since explosion for ?60\% of the events in our sample. This shows that SNe Ic-BL similar to the GRB-associated SNe 1998bw, 2003lw, and 2010bh, or to the relativistic SNe 2009bb and iPTF17cw, are rare. Our results also exclude an association of the SNe Ic-BL in our sample with largely off-axis GRBs with energies E ? 1050 erg. The parameter space of SN 2006aj-like events (faint and fast-peaking radio emission) is, on the other hand, left largely unconstrained, and systematically exploring it represents a promising line of future research.},

The duration of an active phase for a moderate accretion rate is short enough (less than 103-104 yr) that the ejecta are confined within the host galaxy and thus these sources cannot evolve into large size radio galaxies unless they are close to the Eddington limit.},

Images of the variance of radio signals in both time and frequency can be used to detect pulsars in large-scale continuum surveys using the next generation of synthesis radio telescopes. This technique allows a search over the full field of view while avoiding the need for expensive pixel-by-pixel high time resolution searches. We investigate the sensitivity of detecting pulsars in variance images. We show that variance images are most sensitive to pulsars whose scintillation time-scales and bandwidths are close to the subintegration time and channel bandwidth. Therefore, in order to maximize the detection of pulsars for a given radio continuum survey, it is essential to retain a high time and frequency resolution, allowing us to make variance images sensitive to pulsars with different scintillation properties. We demonstrate the technique with Murchision Widefield Array data and show that variance images can indeed lead to the detection of pulsars by distinguishing them from other radio sources.},

After spending almost a decade in a quiescent, radio-silent state, the magnetar was reported to have undergone a radio outburst in 2018 December. We observed radio pulsations from XTE J1810-197 during this early phase of its radio revival using the Ultra-Wideband Low receiver system of the Parkes radio telescope, obtaining wideband (704-4032 MHz) polarization pulse profiles, single pulses, and flux density measurements. Dramatic changes in polarization and rapid variations of the position angle of linear polarization across the main pulse and in time have been observed. The pulse profile exhibits similar structures throughout our three observations (over a week timescale), displaying a small amount of profile evolution in terms of polarization and pulse width across the wideband. We measured a flat radio spectrum across the band with a positive spectral index, in addition to small levels of flux and spectral index variability across our observing span. The observed wideband polarization properties are significantly different compared to those taken after the 2003 outburst, and therefore provide new information about the origin of radio emission.},

Despite the fact that these stars can naturally offer suitable conditions for triggering ECME, only seven such stars have been reported so far within a span of more than two decades. In this paper, we report the discovery of eight more MRPs, thus more than doubling the sample size of such objects. These discoveries are the result of our sub-GHz observation program using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope over the years 2015-2021. Adding these stars to the previously known MRPs, we infer that at least 32\% of the magnetic hot stars exhibit this phenomenon, thus suggesting that observation of ECME is not a rare phenomenon. The significantly larger sample of MRPs allows us for the first time to perform a statistical analysis comparing their physical properties. We present an empirical relation that can be used to predict whether a magnetic hot star is likely to produce ECME. Our preliminary analysis suggests that the physical parameters that play the primary role in the efficiency of the phenomenon are the maximum surface magnetic field strength and the surface temperature. In addition, we present strong evidence of the influence of the plasma density distribution on ECME pulse profiles. Results of this kind further motivate the search for MRPs, as a robust characterization of the relation between observed ECME properties and stellar physical parameters can only be achieved with a large sample.},

With nearly perpendicular rotation and magnetic dipole axes, it represents an extreme case of oblique rotators. The large obliquity is predicted to cause a complex distribution of stellar wind plasma in the magnetosphere. It has been proposed that such a distribution will give rise to a nontrivial frequency dependence of ECME. Indeed we discovered strong frequency dependence of different pulse properties, such as the appearance of secondary pulses, different cutoff frequencies for pulses observed at different rotational phases, etc. But the unique feature that we observed is that while at sub-gigahertz frequencies, the star appears to produce ECME in the extraordinary mode, at gigahertz frequencies, the mode indicated by the pulse property is the ordinary mode. By considering the physical condition needed by such a scenario, we conclude that the required transition of the magnetoionic mode with frequency is unlikely to occur, and the most promising scenario is refraction caused by the complex plasma distribution surrounding the star. This suggests that the conventional way to deduce the magnetoionic mode based on ECME observed at a given frequency is not a reliable method for stars with large misalignment between their rotation and magnetic axes. We also find that ECME exhibits an upper cutoff at ?3.3 GHz, which is much smaller than the frequency corresponding to the maximum stellar magnetic field strength.},

	abstract = {Recent observations have revealed rare, previously unknown flashes of cosmic radio waves lasting from milliseconds to minutes, with a periodicity of minutes to an hour. These transient radio signals must originate from sources in the Milky Way and from coherent emission processes in astrophysical plasma. They are theorized to be produced in the extreme and highly magnetized environments around white dwarfs or neutron stars. However, the astrophysical origin of these signals remains contested, and multiple progenitor models may be needed to explain their diverse properties. Here we present the discovery of a transient radio source, ILT J1101 + 5521, whose roughly minute-long pulses arrive with a periodicity of 125.5 min. We find that ILT J1101 + 5521 is an M dwarf-white dwarf binary system with an orbital period that matches the period of the radio pulses, which are observed when the two stars are in conjunction. The binary nature of ILT J1101 + 5521 establishes that some long-period radio transients originate from orbital motion modulating the observed emission, as opposed to an isolated rotating star. We conclude that ILT J1101 + 5521 is probably a polar system where magnetic interaction has synchronized the rotational and orbital periods of the white dwarf. Magnetic interaction and plasma exchange between two stars has been theorized to generate sporadic radio emission, making ILT J1101 + 5521 a potential low-mass analogue to such mechanisms.},

Measurements of the masses or radii of these objects can strongly constrain the neutron star matter equation of state and rule out theoretical models of their composition. The observed range of neutron star masses, however, has hitherto been too narrow to rule out many predictions of `exotic' non-nucleonic components. The Shapiro delay is a general-relativistic increase in light travel time through the curved space-time near a massive body. For highly inclined (nearly edge-on) binary millisecond radio pulsar systems, this effect allows us to infer the masses of both the neutron star and its binary companion to high precision. Here we present radio timing observations of the binary millisecond pulsar J1614-2230 that show a strong Shapiro delay signature. We calculate the pulsar mass to be (1.97+/-0.04)Msolar, which rules out almost all currently proposed hyperon or boson condensate equations of state (Msolar, solar mass). Quark matter can support a star this massive only if the quarks are strongly interacting and are therefore not `free' quarks.},

	abstract = {Much interest surrounds the nature of the compact remnant that formed in core collapse supernovae (SNe). One means to constrain its nature is to search for signatures of power injection from the remnant in the SN observables years after explosion. In this work, we conduct a large grid of 1D nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium radiative transfer calculations of He-star explosions under the influence of magnetar-power injection from post-explosion age of about one to ten years. Our results for SN observables vary with He-star mass, SN age, injected power, or ejecta clumping. At high mass (model he12p00), the ejecta coolants are primarily O and Ne, with [O I] $\lambda$$\lambda$6300.3, 6363.8, [O II] $\lambda$$\lambda$7319.5, 7330.2, and [O III] $\lambda$$\lambda$4958.9, 5006.8 dominating in the optical, and with strong [Ne II] 12.81 $\mu$m in the infrared {\textendash} this line may carry more than half the total SN luminosity. For lower He-star masses (models he6p00 and he3p30), a greater diversity of coolants appear, in particular Fe, S, Ar, or Ni from the Si- and Fe-rich regions. All models tend to rise in ionization in time, with twice-ionized species (i.e., O III, Ne III, S III, or Fe III) dominating at \~{}10 yr, although this ionization is significantly reduced if clumping is introduced. Our treatment of magnetar power in the form of high-energy electrons or X-ray irradiation yields similar results {\textendash} no X-rays emerge from our ejecta even at ten years because of high-optical depth in the kilo-electronvolt range. An uncertainty of our work concerns the power deposition profile, which is not known from first principles, although this profile could be constrained from observations. Our magnetar-powered model he8p00 with moderate clumping yields a good match to the optical and near-infrared observations of Type Ib SN 2012au at both 289{\textendash}335 d (power of 1 - 2 {\texttimes} 1041 erg s-1) and 2269 d (power of 1040 erg s-1). Unless overly ionized (i.e., if the optical spectrum shows only strong [O III] $\lambda$$\lambda$4958.9, 5006.8), we find that all massive magnetar-powered ejecta should be infrared luminous at 5{\textendash}10 yr through strong [Ne II] 12.81 $\mu$m line emission.},

	abstract = {Radio imaging of the microquasar GRS 1915+105 with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) over a range of wavelengths (13, 3.6, 2.0, and 0.7 cm), in different states of the black hole binary, always resolves the nucleus as a compact jet of length {\textasciitilde}10$\lambda$cm AU. The nucleus is best imaged at the shorter wavelengths, on scales of 2.5-7 AU (0.2-0.6 mas resolution). The brightness temperature of the core is TB{\textgreater}=109 K, and its properties are better fitted by a conically expanding synchrotron jet model rather than a thermal jet. The nuclear jet varies in {\textasciitilde}30 minutes during minor X-ray/radio outbursts and reestablishes within {\textasciitilde}18 hr of a major outburst, indicating the robustness of the X-ray/radio (or disk/jet) system to disruption. At lower resolution (80-240 AU), more extended ejecta are imaged at {\textasciitilde}500 AU separation from the stationary core. Time-lapse images clearly detect the superluminal motion of the ejecta in a few hours. The measured velocity is 1.5c+/-0.1c (D/12 kpc) for the approaching component and is consistent with ballistic motion of the ejecta from 500 AU outward, perhaps even since birth. The axis of the ejecta differs by {\textless}=12{\textdegree} clockwise from the axis of the AU-scale jet, measured in the same observation. Both axes are stable in time (+/-5{\textdegree}), the AU scale for 2 yr and the large scale for over 4 yr. Astrometry over 2 yr relative to an extragalactic reference locates the black hole to +/-1.5 mas, and its secular parallax due to Galactic rotation is 5.8+/-1.5 mas yr-1, consistent with a distance of 12 kpc. Finally, a limit of {\textless}=100 km s-1 is placed on its proper motion with respect to its neighborhood. Some accreting black holes of stellar mass (e.g., Cyg X-1, 1E 1740-2942, GRS 1758-258, GX 339-4) and supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies (e.g., Sgr A*) lack evidence of large flares and discrete transient ejecta but have compact radio cores with steady, flat-spectrum ``plateau'' states, like GRS 1915+105. To the present day GRS 1915+105 is the only system where both AU-scale steady jets and large-scale superluminal ejections have been unambiguously observed. Our observations suggest that the unresolved flat-spectrum radio cores of accreting black holes are compact quasi-continuous synchrotron jets.},

Here we measure the three-dimensional motion of the microquasar GRS 1915+105, using a decade of astrometry with the NRAO Very Long Baseline Array, together with the published radial velocity. The velocity in the Galactic plane deviates from circular rotation by 53-80+/-8 km s-1, where the range covers any specific distance from 6-12 kpc. Perpendicular to the plane, the velocity is only 10+/-4 km s-1. The peculiar velocity is minimized at a distance 9-10 kpc and is then nearly in the radial direction toward the Galactic center. We discuss mechanisms for the origin of the peculiar velocity, and conclude that it is most likely a consequence of Galactic velocity diffusion on this old binary, rather than the result of a supernova kick during the formation of the 14 Msolar black hole. Finally, a brief comparison is made with four other black hole (BH) binaries whose kinematics are well determined.},

We report the discovery of a short-lived radio flare within the X-ray localization error circle of this burst. Such radio flares are seen in about 25\% of GRB afterglows, and their origin is not well understood. The precise radio position enabled us to identify the likely host galaxy of this burst and to measure its redshift, z=0.9578. The host appears to be an interacting/merging system. Under the assumption that the X-ray afterglow is mainly due to synchrotron mechanism, we infer the optical afterglow flux. The observed upper limits to the optical flux are easily explained by invoking an intervening dusty cloud within the host galaxy. These observations support the idea that GRBs with no detectable optical afterglows, or ``dark GRBs,'' can be due to dust extinction within the host galaxies. The census of dark GRBs can then be used to constrain the fraction of the obscured star formation in the universe. We argue that the existing data already indicate that the obscured star formation rate is no more than one-half of that seen at UV and optical wavelengths. Partially based on the observations obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated by the California Association for Research in Astronomy, a scientific partnership among California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.},

These 'ultralong period' (ULP) sources have no clear multiwavelength counterparts and challenge canonical pulsar emission models, leading to debate regarding their nature. In this work, we report the discovery of a bright, highly polarized burst of radio emission at low Galactic latitude as part of a wide-field survey for transient and variable radio sources. ASKAP J175534.9\$-\$252749.1 does not appear to repeat, with only a single intense two-minute \${\textbackslash}sim\$200-mJy burst detected from 60 h of observations. The burst morphology and polarization properties are comparable to those of classical pulsars but the duration is more than one hundred times longer, analogous to ULPs. Combined with the existing ULP population, this suggests that these sources have a strong Galactic latitude dependence and hints at an unexplored population of transient and variable radio sources in the thin disc of the Milky Way. The resemblance of this burst with both ULPs and pulsars calls for a unified coherent emission model for objects with spin periods from milliseconds to tens of minutes. However, whether or not these are all neutron stars or have the same underlying power source remains open for debate.},

Pulsars, magnetars and strongly magnetised white dwarfs have all been seen to been observed to exhibit coherent, pulsed radio emission in relation to their rotational period. Recently, a new type of radio long period transient (LPT) has been discovered. The bright radio emission of LPTs resembles that of radio pulsars and magnetars. However, they pulse on timescales (minutes) much longer than previously seen. While minute timescales are common rotation periods for white dwarfs, LPTs are much brighter than the known pulsating white dwarfs, and dipolar radiation from isolated (as opposed to binary) magnetic white dwarfs has yet to be observed. Here, we report the discovery of a new \${\textbackslash}sim\$421{\textasciitilde}s LPT, CHIME J0630+25, using the CHIME/FRB and CHIME/Pulsar instruments. We used standard pulsar timing techniques and obtained a phase-coherent timing solution which yielded limits on the inferred magnetic field and characteristic age. CHIME J0630+25 is remarkably nearby (\$170 {\textbackslash}pm 80\${\textasciitilde}pc), making it the closest LPT discovered to date.},

They are caused by Galactic plasma structures whose geometry and origin are still poorly understood. In this paper, we construct axisymmentric two-dimensional (2D) column density profiles for the plasma lens and explore the resulting ESEs for both point-like and extended sources. A quantity that becomes relevant is the impact parameter b, namely the distance of the observer's path from the lens' symmetry axis. We demonstrate its effects on the shape of ESE light curves and use it for a phenomenological classification of ESEs into four main types. Three of them are unique outcomes of the 2D model and do not show a characteristic U-shaped dip in the light curve, which has been traditionally used as an identification means of ESEs. We apply our model to five well-studied ESEs and show that elongated plasma tubes or quasi-spherical clouds are favoured over plasma sheets for four of them, while the remaining one is compatible with both lens geometries.},

It is located in the brightest region of a dwarf starburst galaxy at a luminosity distance of 121.6 Mpc. Its 3 GHz luminosity is comparable to luminous radio supernovae associated with dense circumstellar interaction and relativistic outflows. However, its broadband radio spectrum-proportional to $\nu$ -0.35 over a range of ?10{\texttimes} in frequency and fading at a rate of 5\% yr-1-cannot be directly explained by the shock of a stellar explosion. Jets launched by various classes of accreting black holes also struggle to account for VT 1137-0337's combination of observational properties. Instead, we propose that VT 1137-0337 is a decades-old pulsar wind nebula that has recently emerged from within the free-free opacity of its surrounding supernova ejecta. If the nebula is powered by spin-down, the central neutron star should have a surface dipole field of {\textasciitilde}1013-1014 G and a present-day spin period of {\textasciitilde}10-100 ms. Alternatively, the nebula may be powered by the release of magnetic energy from a magnetar. Magnetar nebulae have been proposed to explain the persistent radio sources associated with the repeating fast radio bursts FRB 121102 and FRB 190520B. These FRB persistent sources have not previously been observed as transients but do bear a striking resemblance to VT 1137-0337 in their radio luminosity, spectral index, and host galaxy properties.},

Jansky Very Large Array and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) optical and infrared observations of the extremely active repeating fast radio burst (FRB) FRB 20201124A and its barred spiral host galaxy. We constrain the location and morphology of star formation in the host and search for a persistent radio source (PRS) coincident with FRB 20201124A. We resolve the morphology of the radio emission across all frequency bands and measure a star formation rate (SFR) ? 8.9 M ? yr-1, approximately ?2.5-6 times larger than optically inferred SFRs, demonstrating dust-obscured star formation throughout the host. Compared to a sample of all known FRB hosts with radio emission, the host of FRB 20201124A has the most significantly obscured star formation. While HST observations show the FRB to be offset from the bar or spiral arms, the radio emission extends to the FRB location. We propose that the FRB progenitor could have formed in situ (e.g., a magnetar born from a massive star explosion). It is still plausible, although less likely, that the progenitor of FRB 20201124A migrated from the central bar of the host. We further place a limit on the luminosity of a putative PRS at the FRB position of L 6.0GHz ? 1.8 {\texttimes}1027 erg s-1 Hz-1, among the deepest PRS luminosity limits to date. However, this limit is still broadly consistent with both magnetar nebulae and hypernebulae models assuming a constant energy injection rate of the magnetar and an age of ?105 yr in each model, respectively.},

	abstract = {In the past decade, several rapidly evolving transients have been discovered whose timescales and luminosities are not easily explained by traditional supernovae (SNe) models. The sample size of these objects has remained small due, at least in part, to the challenges of detecting short timescale transients with traditional survey cadences. Here we present the results from a search within the Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep Survey (PS1-MDS) for rapidly evolving and luminous transients. We identify 10 new transients with a time above half-maximum (t 1/2) of less than 12 days and -16.5 {\textgreater} M {\textgreater} -20 mag. This increases the number of known events in this region of SN phase space by roughly a factor of three. The median redshift of the PS1-MDS sample is z = 0.275 and they all exploded in star-forming galaxies. In general, the transients possess faster rise than decline timescale and blue colors at maximum light (g P1 - r P1 lsim -0.2). Best-fit blackbodies reveal photospheric temperatures/radii that expand/cool with time and explosion spectra taken near maximum light are dominated by a blue continuum, consistent with a hot, optically thick, ejecta. We find it difficult to reconcile the short timescale, high peak luminosity (L {\textgreater} 1043 erg s-1), and lack of UV line blanketing observed in many of these transients with an explosion powered mainly by the radioactive decay of 56Ni. Rather, we find that many are consistent with either (1) cooling envelope emission from the explosion of a star with a low-mass extended envelope that ejected very little ({\textless}0.03 M ?) radioactive material, or (2) a shock breakout within a dense, optically thick, wind surrounding the progenitor star. After calculating the detection efficiency for objects with rapid timescales in the PS1-MDS we find a volumetric rate of 4800-8000 events yr-1 Gpc-3 (4\%-7\% of the core-collapse SN rate at z = 0.2).},

	abstract = {The origin and depletion of iron differ from all other abundant refractory elements that make up the composition of interstellar dust. Iron is primarily synthesized in Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and in core collapse supernovae (CCSN), and is present in the outflows from AGB stars. Only the latter two are observed to be sources of interstellar dust since searches for dust in SN Ia have provided strong evidence for the absence of any significant mass of dust in their ejecta. Consequently, more than 65\% of the iron is injected into the ISM in gaseous form. Yet ultraviolet and X-ray observations along many lines of sight in the ISM show that iron is severely depleted in the gas phase as compared to expected solar abundances. The missing iron, comprising about 90\% of the total, is believed to be locked up in interstellar dust. This suggests that most of the missing iron must have precipitated from the ISM gas by a cold accretion onto preexisting silicate, carbon, or composite grains. Iron is thus the only element that requires most of its growth to occur outside the traditional stellar condensation sources. This is a robust statement that does not depend on our evolving understanding of the dust destruction efficiency in the ISM. Reconciling the physical, optical, and chemical properties of such composite grains with their many observational manifestations is a major challenge for understanding the nature and origin of interstellar dust.},

	abstract = {A method of measuring correlation functions without interpolating in the temporal domain, "the discrete correlation function," is introduced. It provides an assumption-free representation of the correlation measured in the data and allows meaningful error estimates. This method avoids the problem of spurious correlations at zero lag due to correlated errors. It is shown that physical interpretation of the cross-correlation function of two series believed to be related by a convolution requires knowledge of the input function's fluctuation power spectrum. In the case of AGN line-continuum cross-correlation functions, the interpretation also involves model dependence in the form of symmetry assumptions and must take into account intrinsic scale bias. Application to published data for Akn 120 and NGC 4151 illustrates this method's capabilities. No correlation was found for the optical data for Akn 120, but the ultraviolet NGC 4151 data show a strong correlation, indicating that the broad C IV feature emanates from a region whose size is greater than 1.2 and less than 20 light-days. These bounds on the size of the line-emitting region in NGC 4151 are in good agreement with the predictions of photoionization models.},

	abstract = {The bright, soft X-ray spectrum Seyfert 1 galaxies Ark 564 and Ton S180 were monitored for 35 days and 12 days, respectively, with ASCA and RXTE (and EUVE for Ton S180). These represent the most intensive X-ray monitoring of any such soft-spectrum Seyfert 1 to date. Light curves were constructed for Ton S180 in six bands spanning 0.1-10 keV and for Ark 564 in five bands spanning 0.7-10 keV. The short-timescale (hours-days) variability patterns were very similar across energy bands, with no evidence of lags between any of the energy bands studied. The fractional variability amplitude was almost independent of energy band, unlike hard-spectrum Seyfert 1 galaxies, which show stronger variations in the softer bands. It is difficult to simultaneously explain soft Seyfert galaxies stronger variability, softer spectra, and weaker energy dependence of the variability relative to hard Seyfert galaxies. There was a trend for soft- and hard-band light curves of both objects to diverge on the longest timescales probed ({\textasciitilde}weeks), with the hardness ratio showing a secular change throughout the observations. This is consistent with the fluctuation power density spectra that showed relatively greater power on long timescales in the softest bands. The simplest explanation of all of these is that two continuum emission components are visible in the X-rays: a relatively hard, rapidly variable component that dominates the total spectrum and a slowly variable soft excess that only shows up in the lowest energy channels of ASCA. Although it would be natural to identify the latter component with an accretion disk and the former with a corona surrounding it, a standard thin disk could not get hot enough to radiate significantly in the ASCA band, and the observed variability timescales are much too short. It also appears that the hard component may have a more complex shape than a pure power law. The most rapid factor of 2 flares and dips occurred within {\textasciitilde}1000 s, in Ark 564 and a bit more slowly in Ton S180. The speed of the luminosity changes rules out viscous or thermal processes and limits the size of the individual emission regions to {\textless}{\textasciitilde}15 Schwarzschild radii (and probably much less), that is, to either the inner disk or small regions in a corona.},

	abstract = {The discovery of a repeating fast radio burst (FRB) has led to the first precise localization, an association with a dwarf galaxy, and the identification of a coincident persistent radio source. However, further localizations are required to determine the nature of FRBs, the sources powering them, and the possibility of multiple populations. Here we investigate the use of associated persistent radio sources to establish FRB counterparts, taking into account the localization area and the source flux density. Due to the lower areal number density of radio sources compared to faint optical sources, robust associations can be achieved for less precise localizations as compared to direct optical host galaxy associations. For generally larger localizations that preclude robust associations, the number of candidate hosts can be reduced based on the ratio of radio-to-optical brightness. We find that confident associations with sources having a flux density of \~{}0.01-1 mJy, comparable to the luminosity of the persistent source associated with FRB 121102 over the redshift range z ? 0.1-1, require FRB localizations of ?20'. We demonstrate that even in the absence of a robust association, constraints can be placed on the luminosity of an associated radio source as a function of localization and dispersion measure (DM). For DM ?1000 pc cm-3, an upper limit comparable to the luminosity of the FRB 121102 persistent source can be placed if the localization is ?10'. We apply our analysis to the case of the ASKAP FRB 170107, using optical and radio observations of the localization region. We identify two candidate hosts based on a radio-to-optical brightness ratio of ?100. We find that if one of these is indeed associated with FRB 170107, the resulting radio luminosity (1029- 4 {\texttimes} 1030 erg s-1 Hz-1, as constrained from the DM value) is comparable to the luminosity of the FRB 121102 persistent source.},

Using Monte Carlo simulations of various CMB survey designs (area, cadence, depth, duration) we estimate the detection rates and the resulting light-curve characteristics. We find that existing and near-term surveys will find tens to hundreds of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs), driven primarily by detections of the reverse shock emission, and including off-axis LGRBs. Next-generation experiments (CMB-S4, CMB-HD) will find tens of FBOTs in the nearby universe and will detect a few tidal disruption events.

	abstract = {We present continued radio and X-ray observations of the relativistic tidal disruption event Swift J164449.3+573451 extending to $\delta$t ? 2000 days after discovery. The radio data were obtained with the Very Large Array (VLA) as part of a long-term program to monitor the energy and dynamical evolution of the jet and to characterize the parsec-scale environment around a previously dormant supermassive black hole. We combine these data with Chandra observations and demonstrate that the X-ray emission following the sharp decline at $\delta$t ? 500 days is likely due to the forward shock. We constrain the synchrotron cooling frequency and the microphysical properties of the outflow for the first time. We find that the cooling frequency evolves through the optical/NIR band at $\delta$t ? 10-200 days, corresponding to ? B ? 10-3, well below equipartition; the X-ray data demonstrate that this deviation from equipartition holds to at least $\delta$t ? 2000 days. We thus recalculate the physical properties of the jet over the lifetime of the event, no longer assuming equipartition. We find a total kinetic energy of E K ? 4 {\texttimes} 1051 erg and a transition to non-relativistic expansion on the timescale of our latest observations (700 days). The density profile is approximately R -3/2 at ?0.3 pc and ?0.7 pc, with a plateau at intermediate scales, characteristic of Bondi accretion. Based on its evolution thus far, we predict that Sw 1644+57 will be detectable at centimeter wavelengths for decades to centuries with existing and upcoming radio facilities. Similar off-axis events should be detectable to z \~{} 2, but with a slow evolution that may inhibit their recognition as transient events.},

	abstract = {We present the detection of an unresolved radio source coincident with the position of the Type I superluminous supernova (SLSN) PTF10hgi (z = 0.098) about 7.5 yr post-explosion, with a flux density of F $\nu$ (6 GHz) ? 47.3 $\mu$Jy and a luminosity of L $\nu$ (6 GHz) ? 1.1 {\texttimes} 1028 erg s-1 Hz-1. This represents the first detection of radio emission coincident with an SLSN on any timescale. We investigate various scenarios for the origin of the radio emission: star formation activity, an active galactic nucleus, and a non-relativistic supernova blastwave. While any of these would be quite novel if confirmed, none appear likely when considered within the context of the other properties of the host galaxy, previous radio observations of SLSNe, and the general population of hydrogen-poor supernovae (SNe). Instead, the radio emission is reminiscent of the quiescent radio source associated with the repeating FRB 121102, which has been argued to be powered by a magnetar born in a SLSN or long gamma-ray burst explosion several decades ago. We show that the properties of the radio source are consistent with a magnetar wind nebula or an off-axis jet, indicating the presence of a central engine. Our directed search for fast radio bursts from the location of PTF10hgi using 40 minutes of Very Large Array phased-array data reveals no detections to a limit of 22 mJy (10$\sigma$ 10 ms duration). We outline several follow-up observations that can conclusively establish the origin of the radio emission.},

	abstract = {The role of relativistic jets in unbinding the stellar envelope during a supernova (SN) associated with a gamma-ray burst (GRB) is unclear. To study that, we explore observational signatures of stellar explosions that are driven by jets. We focus on the final velocity distribution of the outflow in such explosions and compare its observational imprints to SN/GRB data. We find that jet-driven explosions produce an outflow with a flat distribution of energy per logarithmic scale of proper velocity. The flat distribution seems to be universal as it is independent of the jet and the progenitor properties that we explored. The velocity range of the flat distribution for typical GRB parameters is $\gamma$$\beta$ ? 0.03-3, where $\gamma$ is the outflow Lorentz factor and $\beta$ is its dimensionless velocity. A flat distribution is seen also for collimated choked jets where the highest outflow velocity decreases with the depth at which the jet is choked. Comparison to observations of SN/GRBs strongly disfavors jets as the sole explosion source in these events. Instead, in SN/GRB the collapsing star seems to deposit its energy into two channels - a quasi-spherical (or wide angle) channel and a narrowly collimated one. The former carries most of the energy and is responsible for the SN sub-relativistic ejecta while the latter carries 0.01-0.1 of the total outflow energy and is the source of the GRB. Intriguingly, the same two channels, with a similar energy ratio, were seen in the binary neutron star merger GW170817, suggesting that similar engines are at work in both phenomena.},

	abstract = {We present the results of the search for an isotropic stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB) at nanohertz frequencies using the second data release of the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) for 25 millisecond pulsars and a combination with the first data release of the Indian Pulsar Timing Array (InPTA). A robust GWB detection is conditioned upon resolving the Hellings-Downs angular pattern in the pairwise cross-correlation of the pulsar timing residuals. Additionally, the GWB is expected to yield the same (common) spectrum of temporal correlations across pulsars, which is used as a null hypothesis in the GWB search. Such a common-spectrum process has already been observed in pulsar timing data. We analysed (i) the full 24.7-year EPTA data set, (ii) its 10.3-year subset based on modern observing systems, (iii) the combination of the full data set with the first data release of the InPTA for ten commonly timed millisecond pulsars, and (iv) the combination of the 10.3-year subset with the InPTA data. These combinations allowed us to probe the contributions of instrumental noise and interstellar propagation effects. With the full data set, we find marginal evidence for a GWB, with a Bayes factor of four and a false alarm probability of 4\%. With the 10.3-year subset, we report evidence for a GWB, with a Bayes factor of 60 and a false alarm probability of about 0.1\% (?3$\sigma$ significance). The addition of the InPTA data yields results that are broadly consistent with the EPTA-only data sets, with the benefit of better noise modelling. Analyses were performed with different data processing pipelines to test the consistency of the results from independent software packages. The latest EPTA data from new generation observing systems show non-negligible evidence for the GWB. At the same time, the inferred spectrum is rather uncertain and in mild tension with the common signal measured in the full data set. However, if the spectral index is fixed at 13/3, the two data sets give a similar amplitude of (2.5 {\textpm} 0.7) {\texttimes} 10-15 at a reference frequency of 1 yr-1. Further investigation of these issues is required for reliable astrophysical interpretations of this signal. By continuing our detection efforts as part of the International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA), we expect to be able to improve the measurement of spatial correlations and better characterise this signal in the coming years.},

We find significant variability with an RMS of 10-20\% on a timescale of months in radio-quiet and radio-intermediate quasars. This exceeds the variability of radio cores in radio-loud quasars (excluding blazars), which vary only on a few percent level. The variability in radio-quiet quasars confirms that the radio emission in these sources is indeed related to the AGN. The most extremely variable source is the radio-intermediate quasar III Zw 2 which was recently found to contain a relativistic jet. In addition we find large amplitude variabilities (up to 300\% peak-to-peak) in a sample of nearby low-luminosity AGN, Liners and dwarf-Seyferts, on a timescale of 1.5 years. The variability could be related to the activity of nuclear jets responding to changing accretion rates. Simultaneous radio/optical/X-ray monitoring also for radio-weak AGN, and not just for blazars, is therefore a potentially powerful tool to study the link between jets and accretion flows.},

	abstract = {Recently, two ultralong-period radio transients, GLEAM-X J162759.5-523504.3 (J1627) and GPM J1839-10 (J1839), were discovered with spin periods longer than 1000 s. The origin of these two ultralong-period radio transients is intriguing in understanding the spin evolution of neutron stars (NSs). In this work, we examine whether the interaction between strong magnetized NSs and fallback disks can spin NSs down to the observed ultralong period. Our simulations found that the magnetar + fallback disk model can account for the observed period, period derivative, and X-ray luminosity of J1627 in the quasi-spin-equilibrium stage. To evolve to the current state of J1627, the initial mass-accretion rate of the fallback disk and the magnetic field of the NS are in the range of (1.1{\textendash}30) {\texttimes} 1024 g s-1 and (2{\textendash}5) {\texttimes} 1014 G, respectively. In the active lifetime of the fallback disk, it is impossible for J1839 to achieve the observed upper limit of the period derivative. Therefore, we propose that J1839 may be in the second ejector phase after the fallback disk becomes inactive. Those NSs with a magnetic field of (2{\textendash}6) {\texttimes} 1014 G and a fallback disk with an initial mass-accretion rate of \~{}1024{\textendash}1026 g s-1 are possible progenitors of J1839.},

	abstract = {In this paper we study the relation of radio emission to X-ray spectral and variability properties for a large sample of black hole X-ray binary systems. This is done to test, refine and extend - notably into the timing properties - the previously published `unified model' for the coupling of accretion and ejection in such sources. In 14 outbursts from 11 different sources we find that in every case the peak radio flux, on occasion directly resolved into discrete relativistic ejections, is associated with the bright hard to soft state transition near the peak of the outburst. We also note the association of the radio flaring with periods of X-ray flaring during this transition in most, but not all, of the systems. In the soft state, radio emission is in nearly all cases either undetectable or optically thin, consistent with the suppression of the core jet in these states and `relic' radio emission from interactions of previously ejected material and the ambient medium. However, these data cannot rule out an intermittent, optically thin, jet in the soft state. In attempting to associate X-ray timing properties with the ejection events we find a close, but not exact, correspondence between phases of very low integrated X-ray variability and such ejections. In fact the data suggest that there is not a perfect one-to-one correspondence between the radio, X-ray spectral or X-ray timing properties, suggesting that they may be linked simply as symptoms of the underlying state change and not causally to one another. We further study the sparse data on the reactivation of the jet during the transition back to the hard state in decay phase of outbursts, and find marginal evidence for this in one case only. In summary we find no strong evidence against the originally proposed model, confirming and extending some aspects of it with a much larger sample, but note that several aspects remain poorly tested.},

	abstract = {We have compiled and analysed reports from the literature of (quasi-)simultaneous observations of X-ray transients at radio and X-ray wavelengths and compared them with each other and with more unusual radio-bright sources such as Cygnus X-3, GRS 1915+105 and Circinus X-1. There exists a significant ({\textgreater}97 per cent likelihood) positive (rank) correlation between the peak X-ray flux PX and radio flux density PR for the black hole candidate (BHC) systems, and a marginally significant positive (rank) correlation for the neutron star (NS) systems. This is further evidence for a coupling between accretion and outflows in X-ray binary systems, in this case implying a relation between peak disc-accretion rate and the number of synchrotron-emitting electrons ejected. However, we also show that the distribution of `radio loudness', PR/PX, is significantly different for the two samples, in the sense that the BHCs generally have a higher PR/PX ratio. The origin of this discrepancy is uncertain, but probably reflects differences in the energetics and/or radiative efficiency of flows around the neutron stars and black holes; we briefly discuss some of these possibilities. Furthermore, the data for the two recently discovered `fast transients' (FTs), XTE J0421+560/CI Cam and SAX J1819.3-2525/V4641 Sgr are entirely compatible with the distribution of BHCs. As at least three of the BHCs and both FTs have been directly resolved into mildly relativistic jets, it seems likely that such outflows are the origin of the radio emission in all BHC and FT transients, and probably also for the NS transients. We further note that the range of X-ray and radio fluxes observed from the unusual superluminal source GRS 1915+105 is also entirely compatible with the distribution for transients, implying that there is nothing special about the physics of jet formation in that system. We conclude that these data point to the formation of a mildly relativistic jet whose luminosity is a function of the accretion rate in the majority, if not all, X-ray transient outbursts, but whose relation to the observed X-ray emission is dependent on the nature of the accreting compact object.},

	abstract = {We present a unified semiquantitative model for the disc-jet coupling in black hole X-ray binary systems. In the process we have compiled observational aspects from the existing literature, as well as performing new analyses. We argue that during the rising phase of a black hole transient outburst the steady jet known to be associated with the canonical `low/hard' state persists while the X-ray spectrum initially softens. Subsequently, the jet becomes unstable and an optically thin radio outburst is always associated with the soft X-ray peak at the end of this phase of softening. This peak corresponds to a `soft very high state' or `steep power-law' state. Softer X-ray states are not associated with `core' radio emission. We further demonstrate quantitatively that the transient jets associated with these optically thin events are considerably more relativistic than those in the `low/hard' X-ray state. This in turn implies that, as the disc makes its collapse inwards, the jet Lorentz factor rapidly increases, resulting in an internal shock in the outflow, which is the cause of the observed optically thin radio emission. We provide simple estimates for the efficiency of such a shock in the collision of a fast jet with a previously generated outflow that is only mildly relativistic. In addition, we estimate the jet power for a number of such transient events as a function of X-ray luminosity, and find them to be comparable to an extrapolation of the functions estimated for the `low/hard' state jets. The normalization may be larger, however, which may suggest a contribution from some other power source such as black hole spin, for the transient jets.

	abstract = {We report the first observation of a transient relativistic jet from the canonical black hole candidate, Cygnus X-1, obtained with the Multi-Element Radio-Linked Interferometer Network (MERLIN). The jet was observed in only one of six epochs of MERLIN imaging of the source during a phase of repeated X-ray spectral transitions in 2004 Jan-Feb, and this epoch corresponded to the softest 1.5-12keV X-ray spectrum. With only a single epoch revealing the jet, we cannot formally constrain its velocity. Nevertheless, several lines of reasoning suggest that the jet was probably launched 0.5-4.0d before this brightening, corresponding to projected velocities of 0.2c {\textless}{\textasciitilde} vapp {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 1.6c, and an intrinsic velocity of {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}0.3c. We also report the occurrence of a major radio flare from Cyg X-1, reaching a flux density of {\textasciitilde}120mJy at 15GHz, and yet not associated with any resolvable radio emission, despite a concerted effort with MERLIN. We discuss the resolved jet in terms of the recently proposed `unified model' for the disc-jet coupling in black hole X-ray binaries, and tentatively identify the `jet line' for Cyg X-1. The source is consistent with the model in the sense that a steady jet appears to persist initially when the X-ray spectrum starts softening, and that once the spectral softening is complete the core radio emission is suppressed and transient ejecta/shock observed. However, there are some anomalies, and Cyg X-1 clearly does not behave like a normal black hole transient in progressing to the canonical soft/thermal state once the ejection event has happened.},

	abstract = {Many astronomical sources produce transient phenomena at radio frequencies, but the transient sky at low frequencies ({\textless}300 MHz) remains relatively unexplored. Blind surveys with new wide-field radio instruments are setting increasingly stringent limits on the transient surface density on various timescales. Although many of these instruments are limited by classical confusion noise from an ensemble of faint, unresolved sources, one can in principle detect transients below the classical confusion limit to the extent that the classical confusion noise is independent of time. We develop a technique for detecting radio transients that is based on temporal matched filters applied directly to time series of images, rather than relying on source-finding algorithms applied to individual images. This technique has well-defined statistical properties and is applicable to variable and transient searches for both confusion-limited and non-confusion-limited instruments. Using the Murchison Widefield Array as an example, we demonstrate that the technique works well on real data despite the presence of classical confusion noise, sidelobe confusion noise, and other systematic errors. We searched for transients lasting between 2 minutes and 3 months. We found no transients and set improved upper limits on the transient surface density at 182 MHz for flux densities between \~{}20 and 200 mJy, providing the best limits to date for hour- and month-long transients.},

The observations included simultaneous daily measurements at 2.695 and 8.085 GHz of 40 to 150 sources using the Green Bank interferometer over the period 1979-1989. Approximately 330 sources were also monitored with the NRAO 300 foot radio telescope at 3.25 and 4.675 GHz over the 6 month period 1987 December to 1988 May. In total, 594 source-years of observations have been obtained, of which 4.8 yr constitutes the total time span of unusual variability. The unusual variations, denoted as extreme scattering events (ESEs), are summarized here. The most striking property of ESEs is their frequency dependence, in which departures from the quiescent flux density (by as much as 50\% at 2.7 GHz) have no counterpart at 8.1 GHz. The single exception occurred in the 8.1 GHz light curve of 0954+658, which showed spiky variations during the 2.7 GHz event. To date, 10 ESEs have been tentatively identified in the 2.7 GHz light curves of nine quasars. These ESEs appear to occur preferentially near loops in the Galactic foreground brightness distribution. A simple model based on diffraction or refraction through Galactic regions of unusually high electron density turbulence is presented.},

	abstract = {Transient surveys are a vital tool in exploring the dynamic Universe, with radio transients acting as beacons for explosive and highly energetic astrophysical phenomena. However, performing commensal transient surveys using radio imaging can require a significant amount of computing power, data storage, and time. With the instrumentation available to us, and with new and exciting radio interferometers in development, it is essential that we develop efficient methods to probe the radio transient sky. In this paper, we present results from a commensal short-duration transient survey, on time-scales of 8 s, 128 s, and 1 h, using data from the MeerKAT radio telescope. The data set used was obtained as part of a galaxy observing campaign, and we focus on the field of NGC 5068. We present a quick, wide-field imaging strategy to enable fast imaging of large data sets, and develop methods to efficiently filter detected transient candidates. No transient candidates were identified on the time-scales of 8 s, 128 s, and 1 h, leading to competitive limits on the transient surface densities of \$6.7{\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}times \}{\textbackslash}, 10{\textasciicircum}\{-5\}\$, \$1.1{\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}times \}{\textbackslash}, 10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$, and \$3.2{\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}times \}{\textbackslash}, 10{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$ deg-1 at sensitivities of 56.4, 19.2, and 3.9 mJy following primary beam correction for the respective time-scales. We find one possible candidate that could be associated with a stellar flare, which was rejected due to strict image quality control. Further short time-scale radio observations of this candidate could give definite results about its origin.},

We present here a comprehensive multiwavelength data set{\textemdash}from radio to X-rays{\textemdash}for the most gamma-ray-luminous classical nova to date, V1324 Sco. Using this data set, we show that V1324 Sco is a canonical dusty Fe II-type nova, with a maximum ejecta velocity of 2600 km s-1 and an ejecta mass of a few {\texttimes} \{10\}-5 \{M\}? . There is also evidence for complex shock interactions, including a double-peaked radio light curve which shows high brightness temperatures at early times. To explore why V1324 Sco was so gamma-ray luminous, we present a model of the nova ejecta featuring strong internal shocks and find that higher gamma-ray luminosities result from higher ejecta velocities and/or mass-loss rates. Comparison of V1324 Sco with other gamma-ray-detected novae does not show clear signatures of either, and we conclude that a larger sample of similarly well-observed novae is needed to understand the origin and variation of gamma-rays in novae.},

The peak flux density for this burst is similar to typical low-redshift gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We further show that beyond a redshift of order unity, the flux densities of radio afterglows are largely insensitive to redshift, consistent with predictions. By combining the existing X-ray, near-infrared, and radio measurements, we derive estimates for the kinetic energy and opening angle of the blast wave and for the density of the circumburst medium into which it expands. Both the kinetic and radiated energy indicate that GRB 050904 was an unusually energetic burst (1052 ergs). More importantly, we are able to make an in situ measurement of the density structure of the circumburst medium. We conclude that GRB 050904 exploded into a constant-density medium with n0=680 cm-3, which is 2 orders of magnitude above the nominal value for low-redshift GRBs. The next generation of centimeter (EVLA) and millimeter radio instruments (ALMA) will be able to routinely detect events such as GRB 050904 and use them to study magnetic fields and the atomic and molecular gas in the high-redshift universe.},

	abstract = {We present broadband radio observations spanning 1.4-350 GHz of the afterglow of GRB 991216, taken 1-80 days after the burst. The optical and X-ray afterglow of this burst were fairly typical and are explained by a jet fireball. In contrast, the radio afterglow is unusual in two respects: (1) the radio light curve does not show the usual rise to maximum flux on timescales of weeks and instead appears to be declining already on day 1; and (2) the power-law indices show significant steepening from the radio through the X-ray bands. We show that the standard fireball model, in which the afterglow is from a forward shock, is unable to account for point 1, and we conclude that the bulk of the radio emission must arise from a different source. We consider two models, neither of which can be ruled out with the existing data. In the first (conventional) model, the early radio emission is attributed to emission from the reverse shock, as in the case of GRB 990123. In the second ``dual fireball'' model, the radio emission originates from the forward shock of an isotropically energetic fireball (1054 ergs) expanding into a tenuous medium (10-4 cm-3), while the optical and X-ray emission originate in a jetlike outflow. Finally, we note that the near-IR bump of the afterglow is similar to that seen in GRB 971214, and no fireball model can explain this bump.},

The exact cause of these outbursts, and the nature of the energy-loss mechanism that powers them, remain unknown. Here we report the discovery of a fading radio source within the X-ray error box of SGR1900+14. We argue that the radio source is a short-lived cloud of ionized gas, powered by relativistic particles ejected at the time of the intense burst of high-energy photons in late August 1998 (this period of activity also included an extremely energetic burst of $\gamma$-rays on 27 August). As the radio photons are not beamed, our observations allow us to constrain the energy released in the form of particles ejected during the burst. Moreover, the astrometrical precision of radio observations enable us to determine the exact position of the source to very high accuracy.},

The radio light curve of VLA 232937.2-235553 is qualitatively similar to that of several other radio afterglows. At the subarcsecond position provided by the radio detection, optical imaging reveals an extended R=24.9 mag object, which we identify as the host galaxy of GRB 981226. Afterglow models that invoke a jetlike geometry for the outflow or that require an ambient medium with a radial density dependence, such as that produced by a wind from a massive star, are both consistent with the radio data.

	abstract = {The GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky Murchison Widefield Array (GLEAM) is a radio continuum survey at 76-227 MHz of the entire southern sky (Declination \${\textless}{\textbackslash}!\{+\}30{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$ ) with an angular resolution of \$\{?\}2\$ arcmin. In this paper, we combine GLEAM data with optical spectroscopy from the 6dF Galaxy Survey to construct a sample of 1 590 local (median \$z ? 0.064\$ ) radio sources with \$S\_\{200 MHz\} {\textgreater} 55\$ mJy across an area of \$\{?\}16 700 deg2\$ . From the optical spectra, we identify the dominant physical process responsible for the radio emission from each galaxy: 73\% are fuelled by an active galactic nucleus (AGN) and 27\% by star formation. We present the local radio luminosity function for AGN and star-forming (SF) galaxies at 200 MHz and characterise the typical radio spectra of these two populations between 76 MHz and \$\{\~{}\}1\$ GHz. For the AGN, the median spectral index between 200 MHz and \$\{\~{}\}1\$ GHz, \$$\alpha$\_\{high\}\$ , is \$-0.600 {\textpm} 0.010\$ (where \$S ? $\nu${\textasciicircum}\{$\alpha$\}\$ ) and the median spectral index within the GLEAM band, \$$\alpha$\_\{low\}\$ , is \$-0.704 {\textpm} 0.011\$ . For the SF galaxies, the median value of \$$\alpha$\_\{high\}\$ is \$-0.650 {\textpm} 0.010\$ and the median value of \$$\alpha$\_\{low\}\$ is \$-0.596 {\textpm} 0.015\$ . Among the AGN population, flat-spectrum sources are more common at lower radio luminosity, suggesting the existence of a significant population of weak radio AGN that remain core-dominated even at low frequencies. However, around 4\% of local radio AGN have ultra-steep radio spectra at low frequencies ( \$$\alpha$\_\{low\} {\textless} -1.2\$ ). These ultra-steep-spectrum sources span a wide range in radio luminosity, and further work is needed to clarify their nature.},

For a few minutes before an eclipse becomes complete, and for more than 20 minutes after the signal reappears, the pulses are delayed by as much as several hundred microseconds-presumably as a result of propagation through plasma surrounding the companion. The pulsar's orbit about the system barycentre has a radius of 0.089 light seconds projected on to the line of sight. The observed orbital period and size, together with the fact that eclipses occur, imply a surprisingly low companion mass, only a few per cent of the mass of the Sun.},

We review the many recent advances in the study of pulsar wind nebulae, with particular focus on the evolutionary stages through which these objects progress as they expand into their surroundings, and on morphological structures within these nebulae that directly trace the physical processes of particle acceleration and outflow. We conclude by considering some exciting new probes of pulsar wind nebulae, including the study of TeV gamma-ray emission from these sources, and observations of pulsar winds in close binary systems.},

We present here well-sampled spectra and light curves over more than two decades in frequency for a 2 week period. This data set has allowed us for the first time to trace the evolution of the characteristic synchrotron self-absorption frequency $\nu$a, peak frequency $\nu$m, and the peak flux density Fm; we obtain $\nu$a{\textasciitilde}t-0.15+/-0.23, $\nu$m{\textasciitilde}t-1.7+/-0.7, and Fm{\textasciitilde}t-0.47+/-0.20. From the radio data we find that models of homogeneous or wind-generated ambient media with a spherically symmetric outflow can be ruled out. A model in which the relativistic outflow is collimated (a jet) can account for the observed evolution of the synchrotron parameters, the rapid decay at optical wavelengths, and the observed radio-to-optical spectral flux distributions that we present here, provided that the jet transition has not been fully completed in the first 2 weeks after the event. These observations provide additional evidence that rapidly decaying optical/X-ray afterglows are due to jets and that such transitions either develop very slowly or perhaps never reach the predicted asymptotic decay F(t){\textasciitilde}t-p.},

	abstract = {We present radio observations of the afterglow of the bright $\gamma$-ray burst GRB 991208 at frequencies of 1.4, 4.9, and 8.5 GHz, taken between two weeks and 300 days after the burst. The well-sampled radio light curve at 8.5 GHz shows that the flux density peaked about 10 days after the burst and decayed thereafter as a power law FR{\textasciitilde}t-1.07+/-0.09. This decay rate is more shallow than the optical afterglow of GRB 991208 with F0{\textasciitilde}t-2.2, which was measured during the first week. These late-time data are combined with extensive optical, millimeter, and centimeter measurements and fitted to the standard relativistic blast wave model. In agreement with previous findings, we find that an isotropic explosion in a constant-density or wind-blown medium cannot explain these broadband data without modifying the assumption of a single power-law slope for the electron energy distribution. A jetlike expansion provides a reasonable fit to the data. In this case, the flatter radio light curve compared to the optical may be due to emission from an underlying host galaxy, or due to the blast wave making a transition to nonrelativistic expansion. The model that best represents the data is a free-form model in which it is assumed that the broadband emission originates from a synchrotron spectrum, while the time evolution of the break frequencies and peak flux density are solved for explicitly. Although the decay indices for most of the synchrotron parameters are similar to those for the jet model, the evolution of the cooling break is unusually rapid ($\nu$c{\textasciitilde}t-2) and therefore requires some nonstandard evolution in the shock.},

The other star is a compact object, most likely a white dwarf. The quiescency phase is considered, taking into account prenovae, postnovae, the secondary, the primary, masses of the components, light variations, mass transfer rates and the accretion luminosity, the accretion disk, and evolutionary considerations. The outburst is discussed, giving attention to light curves, the spectrum, the velocity structure, and the physical processes in the envelope. A description of theories for the outburst is presented and the postmaximum phase is examined. The fundamental properties of the ejecta are also explored.},

	abstract = {Several independent lines of evidence now point to a connection between the physical processes that govern radio (i.e. jet) and X-ray emission from accreting X-ray binaries. We present a comprehensive study of (quasi-)simultaneous radio-X-ray observations of stellar black hole binaries during the spectrally hard X-ray state, finding evidence for a strong correlation between these two bands over more than three orders of magnitude in X-ray luminosity. The correlation extends from the quiescent regime up to close to the soft state transition, where radio emission starts to decline, sometimes below detectable levels, probably corresponding to the physical disappearance of the jet. The X-ray transient V404 Cygni is found to display the same functional relationship already reported for GX 339-4 between radio and X-ray flux, namely Sradio{\textasciitilde}S+0.7X. In fact, the data for all low/hard state black holes is consistent with a universal relation between the radio and X-ray luminosity of the form Lradio{\textasciitilde}L+0.7X. Under the hypothesis of common physics driving the disc-jet coupling in different sources, the observed spread to the best-fitting relation can be interpreted in terms of a distribution in Doppler factors and hence used to constrain the bulk Lorentz factors of both the radio- and X-ray-emitting regions. Monte Carlo simulations show that, assuming little or no X-ray beaming, the measured scatter in radio power is consistent with Lorentz factors {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 2 for the outflows in the low/hard state, significantly less relativistic than the jets associated with X-ray transients. When combined radio and X-ray beaming is considered, the range of possible jet bulk velocities significantly broadens, allowing highly relativistic outflows, but therefore implying severe X-ray selection effects. If the radio luminosity scales as the total jet power raised to x {\textgreater} 0.7, then there exists an X-ray luminosity below which most of the accretion power will be channelled into the jet, rather than into X-rays. For x= 1.4, as in several optically thick jet models, the power output of `quiescent' black holes may be jet-dominated below LX{\textasciitilde}= 4 {\texttimes} 10-5LEdd.},

The current upper limits for \${\textbackslash}dot\{P\}\$ allow two alternative present states: (1) The disc is still active with ongoing accretion at a low rate such that the accretion luminosity is much less than the neutron star's cooling luminosity, which in turn is below the upper limit for LX. In this scenario, the spin-down will continue at \${\textbackslash}dot\{P\}{\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{-10\}\$ s s-1 until the disc becomes inactive; the final period will be P {\textasciitilde} a few 103 s.

The observational evidence for these rare but illuminating phenomena for probing otherwise dormant MBHs first emerged in archival searches of the soft X-ray ROSAT All-Sky Survey in the 1990s, but has recently accelerated with the increasing survey power in the optical time domain, with tidal disruption events (TDEs) now regarded as a class of optical nuclear transients with distinct spectroscopic features. Multiwavelength observations of TDEs have revealed panchromatic emission, probing a wide range of scales, from the innermost regions of the accretion flow to the surrounding circumnuclear medium. I review the current census of 56 TDEs reported in the literature, and their observed properties can be summarized as follows: The optical light curves follow a power-law decline from peak that scales with the inferred central black hole mass as expected for the fallback rate of the stellar debris, but the rise time does not. The UV-optical and soft X-ray thermal emission come from different spatial scales, and their intensity ratio has a large dynamic range and is highly variable, providing important clues as to what is powering the two components. They can be grouped into three spectral classes, and those with Bowen fluorescence line emission show a preference for a hotter and more compact line-emitting region, whereas those with only HeII emission lines are the rarest class.},

Previous candidate flares have had declining light curves in good agreement with expectations, but with poor constraints on the time of disruption and the type of star disrupted, because the rising emission was not observed. Recently, two `relativistic' candidate tidal disruption events were discovered, each of whose extreme X-ray luminosity and synchrotron radio emission were interpreted as the onset of emission from a relativistic jet. Here we report a luminous ultraviolet-optical flare from the nuclear region of an inactive galaxy at a redshift of 0.1696. The observed continuum is cooler than expected for a simple accreting debris disk, but the well-sampled rise and decay of the light curve follow the predicted mass accretion rate and can be modelled to determine the time of disruption to an accuracy of two days. The black hole has a mass of about two million solar masses, modulo a factor dependent on the mass and radius of the star disrupted. On the basis of the spectroscopic signature of ionized helium from the unbound debris, we determine that the disrupted star was a helium-rich stellar core.},

	abstract = {Orphan Afterglows (OA) are slow transients produced by Gamma Ray Bursts seen off-axis that become visible on timescales of days/years at optical/NIR and radio frequencies, when the prompt emission at high energies (X and $\gamma$ rays) has already ceased. Given the typically estimated jet opening angle of GRBs $\theta$jet {\textasciitilde} 3{\textdegree}, for each burst pointing to the Earth there should be a factor {\textasciitilde} 700 more GRBs pointing in other directions. Despite this, no secure OAs have been detected so far. Through a population synthesis code we study the emission properties of the population of OA at radio frequencies. OAs reach their emission peak on year-timescales and they last for a comparable amount of time. The typical peak fluxes (which depend on the observing frequency) are of few $\mu$Jy in the radio band with only a few OA reaching the mJy level. These values are consistent with the upper limits on the radio flux of SN Ib/c observed at late times. We find that the OA radio number count distribution has a typical slope - 1.7 at high fluxes and a flatter ( - 0.4) slope at low fluxes with a break at a frequency-dependent flux. Our predictions of the OA rates are consistent with the (upper) limits of recent radio surveys and archive searches for radio transients. Future radio surveys like VAST/ASKAP at 1.4 GHz should detect {\textasciitilde} 3 {\texttimes} 10- 3 OA deg- 2 yr- 1, MeerKAT and EVLA at 8.4 GHz should see {\textasciitilde} 3 {\texttimes} 10- 1 OA deg- 2 yr- 1. The SKA, reaching the $\mu$Jy flux limit, could see up to {\textasciitilde} 0.2 - 1.5 OA deg- 2 yr- 1. These rates also depend on the duration of the OA above a certain flux limit and we discuss this effect with respect to the survey cadence.},

	abstract = {The tidal disruption of a star by a supermassive black hole provides us with a rare glimpse of these otherwise dormant beasts. It has long been predicted that the disruption will be accompanied by a thermal 'flare', powered by the accretion of bound stellar debris. Several candidate disruptions have been discovered in this manner at optical, ultraviolet and X-ray wavelengths. Here we explore the observational consequences if a modest fraction of the accretion power is channelled into an ultrarelativistic outflow. We show that a relativistic jet decelerates due to its interaction with the interstellar medium at subparsec distances from the black hole. Synchrotron radiation from electrons accelerated by the reverse shock powers a bright radio-infrared transient that peaks on a time-scale \~{}1 yr after disruption. Emission from the forward shock may be detectable for several years after the peak. Deep radio follow-up observations of tidal disruption candidates at late times can test for the presence of relativistic ejecta. Upcoming radio transient surveys may independently discover tens to hundreds of tidal disruptions per year, complimenting searches at other wavelengths. Non-thermal emission from tidal disruption probes the physics of jet formation under relatively clean conditions.},

The high angular resolution (mas) of our observations allowed us, for the second time ever, after GRB 030329, to measure the projected size, s, of the relativistic shock caused by the expansion of the GRB ejecta into the surrounding medium. Our observations support the expansion of the shock with a {\textgreater} 4$\sigma$-equivalent significance, and confirm its relativistic nature by revealing an apparently superluminal expansion rate. Fitting a power law expansion model, s ? ta, to the observed size evolution, we find a slope a = 0.69-0.14+0.13. Fitting the data at each frequency separately, we find different expansion rates, pointing to a frequency-dependent behaviour. We show that the observed size evolution can be reconciled with a reverse shock plus forward shock, provided that the two shocks dominate the emission at different frequencies and, possibly, at different times.},

Radio observations of TDEs trace outflows and jets that may be produced. Radio detections of the outflows from TDEs are uncommon, with only about one-third of TDEs discovered to date having published radio detections. Here, we present over 2 yr of comprehensive, multiradio frequency monitoring observations of the TDE AT2019azh taken with the Very Large Array and MeerKAT radio telescopes from approximately 10 d pre-optical peak to 810 d post-optical peak. AT2019azh shows unusual radio emission for a thermal TDE, as it brightened very slowly over 2 yr, and showed fluctuations in the synchrotron energy index of the optically thin synchrotron emission from 450 d post-disruption. Based on the radio properties, we deduce that the outflow in this event is likely non-relativistic and could be explained by a spherical outflow arising from self-stream intersections or a mildly collimated outflow from accretion on to the supermassive black hole. This data set provides a significant contribution to the observational data base of outflows from TDEs, including the earliest radio detection of a non-relativistic TDE to date, relative to the optical discovery.},

Radio observations of TDEs trace synchrotron emission from outflowing material that may be ejected from the inner regions of the accretion flow around the supermassive black hole or by the tidal debris stream. Radio detections of TDEs are rare, but provide crucial information about the launching of jets and outflows from supermassive black holes and the circumnuclear environment in galaxies. Here, we present the radio detection of the TDE AT2020opy, including three epochs of radio observations taken with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, MeerKAT, and upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio telescope. AT2020opy is the most distant thermal TDE with radio emission reported to date, and from modelling the evolving synchrotron spectra we deduce that the host galaxy has a more dense circumnuclear medium than other thermal TDEs detected in the radio band. Based on an equipartition analysis of the synchrotron spectral properties of the event, we conclude that the radio-emitting outflow was likely launched approximately at the time of, or just after, the initial optical flare. We find no evidence for relativistic motion of the outflow. The high luminosity of this event supports that a dense circumnuclear medium of the host galaxy produces brighter radio emission that rises to a peak more quickly than in galaxies with lower central densities.},

	abstract = {We present the discovery of a second radio flare from the tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2020vwl via long-term monitoring radio observations. Late-time radio flares from TDEs are being discovered more commonly, with many TDEs showing radio emission 1000s of days after the stellar disruption, but the mechanism that powers these late-time flares is uncertain. Here we present radio spectral observations of the first and second radio flares observed from the TDE AT2020vwl. Through detailed radio spectral monitoring, we find evidence for two distinct outflow ejection episodes, or a period of renewed energy injection into the pre-existing outflow. We deduce that the second radio flare is powered by an outflow that is initially slower than the first flare, but carries more energy and accelerates over time. Through modelling the long-term optical and UV emission from the TDE as arising from an accretion disc, we infer that the second radio outflow launch or energy injection episode occurred approximately at the time of peak accretion rate. The fast decay of the second flare precludes environmental changes as an explanation, while the velocity of the outflow is at all times too low to be explained by an off-axis relativistic jet. Future observations that search for any link between the accretion disc properties and late time radio flares from TDEs will aid in understanding what powers the radio outflows in TDEs, and confirm if multiple outflow ejections or energy injection episodes are common.},

We find radio sources coincident with half of the transient events (11 TDEs), with 8 radio sources showing statistically significant variability over a 6-month period. We model the radio spectra of 6 sources with sufficiently bright radio emission and find the sources show radio spectra consistent with optically thin synchrotron emission and radio outflow minimum radii of \$10{\textasciicircum}\{16\}\$--\$10{\textasciicircum}\{17\}\$ cm, velocities 0.01--0.05 c, and energies \$10{\textasciicircum}\{48\}\$--\$10{\textasciicircum}\{51\}\$ erg. On comparison with the radio properties of an optically-selected TDE sample at similar late times, we find no significant difference in the radio luminosity range or radio detection rate. We find a tentative positive trend with peak radio and X-ray luminosity, but require further observations to determine if this is real or due to observational bias due to the large range in distances of the events. Interestingly, none of the X-ray selected events show late rising radio emission, compared to 45\% of radio-detected sources of an optically-selected sample that showed late rising radio emission. We propose that this may indicate that many TDEs launch radio outflows at or near peak X-ray luminosity, which can be significantly delayed from peak optical luminosity. This study presents the first systematic analysis of the radio properties of an X-ray selected sample of TDEs, and gives insight into the possible link between the physical processes that power X-ray and radio emission in TDEs.},

We argue here that any such superluminal motion13, if microlensed by a star in an intervening galaxy, can produce the requisite ultra-rapid variations, even in the absence of intrinsic flux variations in the jet.

We also perform extensive simulations to quantify the selection effects (such as the source brightness or the length of observation) that might prevent the detection of variability. We quantify variability in terms of a `normalized variability amplitude' (NVA ) derived from the power spectrum of each light curve. Of the 32 sources observed, we detect variability in 12. We find that, contrary to some previous claims, there is no evidence that sources change the character of their variability between observations. We confirm that there is a strong inverse correlation between NVA and source luminosity which can be simply explained if source size scales with luminosity. A further result is that the sources with the steepest energy spectra are possibly the most variable. One explanation of the latter result, in the context of reprocessing models, might be that sources with steeper energy spectra contain a smaller reflected or reprocessed component, which might be expected to vary less rapidly than the direct component. We briefly discuss a small number of light curves obtained using the low-energy telescope on EXOSAT, and confirm that their power spectra are steeper than those of the corresponding medium-energy light curves. The power spectra are consistent with both multiple decay shot-noise models and with the rotating-spot models. In the case of the rotating- spot model we can place upper limits on the central black hole masses of typically a few x 10{\textasciicircum}7{\textasciicircum} M\_sun\_.

	abstract = {Aims: With the afterglow of GRB 100621A being the brightest detected so far in X-rays, and superb GROND coverage in the optical/near-infrared during the first few hours, an observational verification of basic fireball predictions seemed possible. Methods: In order to constrain the broad-band spectral energy distribution of the afterglow of GRB 100621A, dedicated observations were performed in the optical/near-infrared with the 7-channel Gamma-Ray Burst Optical and Near-infrared Detector (GROND) at the 2.2 m MPG/ESO telescope, in the sub-millimeter band with the large bolometer array LABOCA at APEX, and at radio frequencies with ATCA. Utilizing also Swift X-ray observations, we attempt an interpretation of the observational data within the fireball scenario. Results: The afterglow of GRB 100621A shows a very complex temporal and spectral evolution. We identify three different emission components, the most spectacular one causing a sudden intensity jump about one hour after the prompt emission. The spectrum of this component is much steeper than the canonical afterglow. We interpret this component using a two-shell collision prescription after the first shell has been decelerated by the circumburst medium. We use the fireball scenario to derive constraints on the microphysical parameters of the first shell. Long-term energy injection into a narrow jet seems to provide an adequate description. Another noteworthy result is the large (AV = 3.6 mag) line-of-sight host extinction of the afterglow in an otherwise extremely blue host galaxy. Conclusions: Some GRB afterglows have shown complex features, and that of GRB 100621A is another good example. Yet, detailed observational campaigns of the brightest afterglows promise to deepen our understanding of the formation of afterglows and the subsequent interaction with the circumburst medium.

	abstract = {Radio astronomy has provided evidence for the presence of ionized atmospheres around almost all classes of nondegenerate stars. Magnetically confined coronae dominate in the cool half of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. Their radio emission is predominantly of nonthermal origin and has been identified as gyrosynchrotron radiation from mildly relativistic electrons, apart from some coherent emission mechanisms. Ionized winds are found in hot stars and in red giants. They are detected through their thermal, optically thick radiation, but synchrotron emission has been found in many systems as well. The latter is emitted presumably by shock-accelerated electrons in weak magnetic fields in the outer wind regions. Radio emission is also frequently detected in pre-main sequence stars and protostars and has recently been discovered in brown dwarfs. This review summarizes the radio view of the atmospheres of nondegenerate stars, focusing on energy release physics in cool coronal stars, wind phenomenology in hot stars and cool giants, and emission observed from young and forming stars.},

Our search used the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey, which covered the entire sky south of declination \$+41{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$ ( \$\~{}\$ \$34000\$ square degrees) at a central frequency of 887.5 MHz, the Variables and Slow Transients Pilot Survey, which covered \$\~{}\$ \$5000\$ square degrees per epoch (887.5 MHz), and other ASKAP pilot surveys, which covered \$\~{}\$ 200-2000 square degrees with 2-12 h integration times. We crossmatched radio sources found in these surveys over a two-year period, from 2019 April to 2021 August, with 440 previously identified optical novae, and found radio counterparts for four novae: V5668 Sgr, V1369 Cen, YZ Ret, and RR Tel. Follow-up observations with the Australian Telescope Compact Array confirm the ejecta thinning across all observed bands with spectral analysis indicative of synchrotron emission in V1369 Cen and YZ Ret. Our light-curve fit with the Hubble Flow model yields a value of \$1.65{\textpm} 0.17 {\texttimes} 10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\} M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ for the mass ejected in V1369 Cen. We also derive a peak surface brightness temperature of \$250{\textpm}80\$ K for YZ Ret. Using Hubble Flow model simulated radio lightcurves for novae, we demonstrate that with a 5 \$$\sigma$\$ sensitivity limit of 1.5 mJy in 15-min survey observations, we can detect radio emission up to a distance of 4 kpc if ejecta mass is in the range \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ , and upto 1 kpc if ejecta mass is in the range \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-5\}\$ - \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ .

	abstract = {The evolution of the dynamic spectra of eight pulsars over 16 months is reported. Observations were made at Jodrell Bank at 408 MHz from 1984 September to 1986 January. The changing form of the spectra is interpreted as refractive modulation of diffractive interstellar scintillation. The correlation function versus time and frequency was computed for each observation and estimates were made of the apparent decorrelation widths in frequency and time, and the frequency drift rate of scintillation features. A model is developed for how these three parameters vary with epoch under changing angles of refraction. The model successfully describes the variations for four of the pulsars, for which the drift rate shows some sign reversals between epochs. Two pulsars kept a constant sign of drift rate, which we interpret as due to persistent refracting structures in their lines of sight, which are consistent with an intervening H ii region. Studies were made of the variability of the diffractive bandwidth, the visibility of the drifting features in the dynamic spectra, the refractive shifts and the speed estimated for the diffraction pattern. These quantities mostly agree with expectations from the model. The pulsar PSRB2016+28, which has an unusually low proper motion, shows clear modulation of the pattern speed by the Earth's annual motion. In the 11 epochs observed for PSRB2016+28, two showed unmistakable periodic modulation in the dynamic spectra. Several other pulsars exhibited occasional periodic patterns with low modulation. The phenomenon varies substantially between the pulsars, being more common for lower strengths of scattering. Key words: radiative transfer - pulsars: general - pulsars: individual: PSRB2016+28 - ISM: general.},

Simultaneous photometric monitoring observations have established this periodicity to be the rotation period of the dwarf. These bursts, which were not present in previous observations of this target, confirm that ultracool dwarfs can generate persistent levels of broadband, coherent radio emission, associated with the presence of kG magnetic fields in a large-scale, stable configuration. Compact sources located at the magnetic polar regions produce highly beamed emission generated by the electron cyclotron maser instability, the same mechanism known to generate planetary coherent radio emission in our solar system. The narrow beams of radiation pass our line of sight as the dwarf rotates, producing the associated periodic bursts. The resulting radio light curves are analogous to the periodic light curves associated with pulsar radio emission highlighting TVLM 513-46546 as the prototype of a new class of transient radio source.},

	abstract = {Surveys for transient and variable phenomena can be confounded by the presence of extrinsic variability such as refractive interstellar scintillation (RISS). We have developed an all-sky model for RISS which can predict variability on a variety of timescales, survey locations, and observing frequencies. The model makes use of Halpha intensity maps to probe the emission measure along the line of sight, convert this to a scattering measure, and finally a scintillation strength. The model uses previously developed and long understood physics along with (indirect) measurements of the electron content and distribution within the Milky Way. We develop a set of expectations that are useful in the planning of future surveys for transient and radio variability, and demonstrate that the 1-GHz sky is a poor predictor of the variable nature of the \$100\$-MHz sky. Interestingly, the correlation between the incidence of variability and Galactic latitude which has been seen at 1GHz, is reversed at 100MHz. We compare the predictions of our model to a low-frequency radio survey that was conducted with the Murchison Widefield Array, and find good qualitative agreement. We discuss the implications, current limitations, and future development of the model. The model has been implemented in a Python code and is available on GitHub/Zenodo.},

This luminosity implies an upper limit on the average companion stellar wind mass-loss rate of 1.3 {\texttimes} 10-7 M sun yr-1. This mass-loss rate is consistent with the double degenerate scenario for SNeIa and rules out intermediate- and high-mass companions in the single degenerate scenario.

Broadband afterglow observations, spanning from X-ray to radio frequencies, provide a probe of the density structure of the circumburst medium, as well as of the ejecta energetics, geometry, and physical parameters of the relativistic blast wave resulting from the explosion. We present an analysis of Chandra X-Ray Observatory observations of this event, along with Hubble Space Telescope and radio monitoring data. We combine these data with ground-based optical and IR observations and fit the synthesized afterglow light curve using models where collimated ejecta expand into a surrounding medium. We find that we can explain the broadband light curve with reasonable physical parameters if the cooling is dominated by inverse Compton scattering. For this model, an excess due to inverse Compton scattering appears above the best-fit synchrotron spectrum in the X-ray band. No previous bursts have exhibited this component, and its observation would imply that the GRB exploded in a moderately dense (n{\textasciitilde}30 cm-3) medium, consistent with a diffuse interstellar cloud environment.},

We map, as a function of mass and metallicity, where black holes and neutron stars are likely to form and where different types of supernovae are produced. Integrating over an initial mass function, we derive the relative populations as a function of metallicity.

These clouds must be very dense, with M {\textasciitilde} 0.1 M\_sun\_ and R {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 10{\textasciicircum}14{\textasciicircum} cm. In all likelihood, the clouds will be members of a family of objects with different sizes and masses. We therefore expect events of longer duration than the ones reported by the MACHO and EROS groups but with light curves very different from the ones derived assuming a point-mass lens. We suggest that one such event has already been observed in radio measurements of the quasar 1502 + 106. The abundances of free electrons, metals, complex molecules, and dust grains are constrained to be very small, suggesting that the clouds are formed from a primordial mixture of hydrogen and helium. Cosmic rays and background ultraviolet radiation ionize a halo around the cloud. Radio waves from distant sources will be scattered by the electrons in this halo, an effect which may have already been observed in quasars such as 1502 + 106. We argue that dark clouds are a viable alternative to compact objects for baryonic dark matter in the halo.},

The data for FH Ser and V1500 Cyg constitute a complete history of the important phases of their radio 'light' curves, while all but the rising portion of the optically thick phase of an expanding nova shell is present for HR Del. A simple solution of the spherically symmetric equations of mass and momentum conservation for an isothermal gas, for which pressure gradients are effectively decoupled from the dynamics, is shown to fit the radio data for all three novae quite well. The main features of this model are strong density and velocity gradients that lead to long periods when the 'observable' shell evolves from an optically thick 'disk' to a completely optically thin shell.},

However, 1E 161348-5055 has an observed period of 6.67 h, in contrast to magnetars which have a spin period of seconds. Here we describe a simple model which can explain the spin evolution of 1E 161348-5055, as well as other magnetars, from an initial period of milliseconds that would be required for dynamo generation of magnetar-strength magnetic fields. We propose that the key difference between 1E 161348-5055 and other magnetars is the persistence of a remnant disc of small total mass. This disc caused 1E 161348-5055 to undergo ejector and propeller phases in its life, during which strong torques caused a rapid increase of its spin period. By matching its observed spin period and ?1-3 kyr age, we find that 1E 161348-5055 has the (slightly) highest magnetic field of all known magnetars, with B \~{} 5 {\texttimes} 1015 G, and that its disc had a mass of \~{}1024 g, comparable to that of the asteroid Ceres.},

	abstract = {We present ZTF18abvkwla (the "Koala"), a fast blue optical transient discovered in the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) One-Day Cadence (1DC) Survey. ZTF18abvkwla has a number of features in common with the groundbreaking transient AT 2018cow: blue colors at peak ( \$g-r{\textbackslash}approx -0.5\$ mag), a short rise time from half-max of under two days, a decay time to half-max of only three days, a high optical luminosity ( \$\{M\}\_\{g,{\textbackslash}mathrm\{peak\}\}{\textbackslash}approx -20.6\$ mag), a hot (?40,000 K) featureless spectrum at peak light, and a luminous radio counterpart. At late times ( \$\{{\textbackslash}rm\{{\textbackslash}Delta \}\}t 80{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{days\}\$ ), the radio luminosity of ZTF18abvkwla ( \${\textbackslash}nu \{L\}\_\{{\textbackslash}nu \}rsim \{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{40\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{erg\}{\textbackslash},\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{s\}\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ at 10 \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{GHz\}\$ , observer-frame) is most similar to that of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The host galaxy is a dwarf starburst galaxy ( \$M{\textbackslash}approx 5{\textbackslash}times \{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{8\}{\textbackslash},\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ , \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{SFR\}{\textbackslash}approx 7{\textbackslash},\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{yr\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ ) that is moderately metal-enriched ( \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{log\}[\{{\textbackslash}rm\{O\}\}/\{{\textbackslash}rm\{H\}\}]{\textbackslash}approx 8.5\$ ), similar to the hosts of GRBs and superluminous supernovae. As in AT2018cow, the radio and optical emission in ZTF18abvkwla likely arise from two separate components: the radio from fast-moving ejecta ( \$\{{\textbackslash}rm\{{\textbackslash}Gamma \}\}{\textbackslash}beta c 0.38c\$ ) and the optical from shock-interaction with confined dense material ({\textless}0.07 M? in \${\textbackslash}sim \{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{15\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{cm\}\$ ). Compiling transients in the literature with \$\{t\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{rise\}\} 5{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{days\}\$ and \$\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{peak\}\} -20\$ mag, we find that a significant number are engine-powered, and suggest that the high peak optical luminosity is directly related to the presence of this engine. From 18 months of the 1DC survey, we find that transients in this rise-luminosity phase space are at least two to three orders of magnitude less common than CC SNe. Finally, we discuss strategies for identifying such events with future facilities like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, as well as prospects for detecting accompanying X-ray and radio emission.},

Here we present detailed millimeter- through centimeter-wave observations of a similar transient, ZTF 20acigmel (AT 2020xnd), at z = 0.2433. Using observations from the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array and the Very Large Array, we model the unusual millimeter and radio emission from AT 2020xnd under several different assumptions and ultimately favor synchrotron radiation from a thermal electron population (relativistic Maxwellian). The thermal electron model implies a fast but subrelativistic (v ? 0.3c) shock and a high ambient density (n e ? 4 {\texttimes} 103 cm-3) at $\Delta$t ? 40 days. The X-ray luminosity of L X ? 1043 erg s-1 exceeds simple predictions from the radio and UVOIR luminosity and likely has a separate physical origin, such as a central engine. Using the fact that month-long luminous (L $\nu$ ? 2 {\texttimes} 1030 erg s-1 Hz-1 at 100 GHz) millimeter emission appears to be a generic feature of transients with fast (t 1/2 ? 3 days) and luminous (M peak ? -21 mag) optical light curves, we estimate the rate at which transients like AT 2018cow and AT 2020xnd will be detected by future wide-field millimeter transient surveys such as CMB-S4 and conclude that energetic explosions in dense environments may represent a significant population of extragalactic transients in the 100 GHz sky.},

Their short observed duration implies a different powering mechanism from the most common luminous extragalactic transients (supernovae), whose timescale is weeks2. Some short-duration transients, most notably AT2018cow (ref. 3), show blue optical colours and bright radio and X-ray emission4. Several AT2018cow-like transients have shown hints of a long-lived embedded energy source5, such as X-ray variability6,7, prolonged ultraviolet emission8, a tentative X-ray quasiperiodic oscillation9,10 and large energies coupled to fast (but subrelativistic) radio-emitting ejecta11,12. Here we report observations of minutes-duration optical flares in the aftermath of an AT2018cow-like transient, AT2022tsd (the `Tasmanian Devil'). The flares occur over a period of months, are highly energetic and are probably nonthermal, implying that they arise from a near-relativistic outflow or jet. Our observations confirm that, in some AT2018cow-like transients, the embedded energy source is a compact object, either a magnetar or an accreting black hole.},

We identify 38 candidates with durations above half-maximum light 1 day {\textless} t 1/2 {\textless} 12 days, of which 28 have blue (g - r ? -0.2 mag) colors at peak light. Of the 38 transients (28 FBOTs), 19 (13) can be spectroscopically classified as core-collapse supernovae (SNe): 11 (8) H- or He-rich (Type II/IIb/Ib) SNe, 6 (4) interacting (Type IIn/Ibn) SNe, and 2 (1) H\&He-poor (Type Ic/Ic-BL) SNe. Two FBOTs (published previously) had predominantly featureless spectra and luminous radio emission: AT2018lug (The Koala) and AT2020xnd (The Camel). Seven (five) did not have a definitive classification: AT 2020bdh showed tentative broad H$\alpha$ in emission, and AT 2020bot showed unidentified broad features and was 10 kpc offset from the center of an early-type galaxy. Ten (eight) have no spectroscopic observations or redshift measurements. We present multiwavelength (radio, millimeter, and/or X-ray) observations for five FBOTs (three Type Ibn, one Type IIn/Ibn, one Type IIb). Additionally, we search radio-survey (VLA and ASKAP) data to set limits on the presence of radio emission for 24 of the transients. All X-ray and radio observations resulted in nondetections; we rule out AT2018cow-like X-ray and radio behavior for five FBOTs and more luminous emission (such as that seen in the Camel) for four additional FBOTs. We conclude that exotic transients similar to AT2018cow, the Koala, and the Camel represent a rare subset of FBOTs and use ZTF's SN classification experiments to measure the rate to be at most 0.1\% of the local core-collapse SN rate.},

	abstract = {We report on a blind survey for extragalactic radio variability that was carried out by comparing two epochs of data from the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty centimeters survey with a third epoch from a new 1.4 GHz survey of SDSS Stripe 82. The three epochs are spaced seven years apart and have an overlapping area of 60 deg2. We uncover 89 variable sources down to the millijansky level, 75 of which are newly identified, and we find no evidence for transient phenomena. This new sample of variable sources allows us to infer an upper limit to the mean characteristic timescale of active galactic nucleus radio variability of 14 yr. We find that only 1\% of extragalactic sources have fractional variability f var {\textgreater} 3, while 44\% of Galactic sources vary by this much. The variable sample contains a larger fraction of quasars than a comparable non-variable control sample, though the majority of the variable sources appear to be extended galaxies in the optical. This implies that either quasars are not the dominant contributor to the variability of the sample, or that the deep optical data allow us to detect the host galaxies of some low-z quasars. We use the new, higher resolution data to report on the morphology of the variable sources. Finally, we show that the fraction of sources that are variable remains constant or increases at low flux densities. This may imply that next generation radio surveys with telescopes like Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder and MeerKAT will see a constant or even increasing fraction of variable sources down into the sub-millijansky regime.},

Standard weighted least-squares fitting is only appropriate when there is a dimension along which the data points have negligible uncertainties, and another along which all the uncertainties can be described by Gaussians of known variance; these conditions are rarely met in practice. We consider cases of general, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily covariant two-dimensional uncertainties, and situations in which there are bad data (large outliers), unknown uncertainties, and unknown but expected intrinsic scatter in the linear relationship being fit. Above all we emphasize the importance of having a "generative model" for the data, even an approximate one. Once there is a generative model, the subsequent fitting is non-arbitrary because the model permits direct computation of the likelihood of the parameters or the posterior probability distribution. Construction of a posterior probability distribution is indispensible if there are "nuisance parameters" to marginalize away.},

	abstract = {Radio emission from tidal disruption events (TDEs) originates from an interaction of an outflow with the super-massive black hole (SMBH) circumnuclear material (CNM). In turn, this radio emission can be used to probe properties of both the outflow launched at the event and the CNM. Until recently, radio emission was detected only for a relatively small number of events. While the observed radio emission pointed to either relativistic or sub-relativistic outflows of different nature, it also indicated that the outflow has been launched shortly after stellar disruption. Recently, however, delayed radio flares, several months and years after stellar disruption, were reported in the case of the TDE ASASSN-15oi. These delayed flares suggest a delay in the launching of outflows and thus may provide new insights into SMBH accretion physics. Here, we present a new radio data set of another TDE, iPTF 16fnl, and discuss the possibility that a delayed radio flare also has been observed in this case, {\textasciitilde}5 months after optical discovery, suggesting that this phenomenon may be common in TDEs. Unlike ASASSN-15oi, the data for iPTF 16fnl is sparse and the delayed radio flare can be explained by several alternative models: among them are a complex varying CNM density structure and a delayed outflow ejection.},

Radio emission has been detected in only a handful of TDEs so far. Here we report the detection of delayed radio flares from an optically discovered TDE. Our prompt radio observations of the TDE ASASSN-15oi showed no radio emission until the detection of a flare six months later, followed by a second and brighter flare years later. We find that the standard scenario, in which an outflow is launched briefly after the stellar disruption, is unable to explain the combined temporal and spectral properties of the delayed flare. We suggest that the flare is due to the delayed ejection of an outflow, perhaps following a transition in accretion states. Our discovery motivates observations of TDEs at various timescales and highlights a need for new models.},

We present our analysis of the radio and X-ray observations, yielding the tightest constraints yet placed on the pre-explosion mass-loss rate from the progenitor system of this supernova.

We discuss our results in the context of single-degenerate models for SNe Ia and find that our observations modestly disfavor symbiotic progenitor models involving a red giant donor, but cannot constrain systems accreting from main-sequence or sub-giant stars, including the popular supersoft channel. In view of the proximity of PTF11kly and the sensitivity of our prompt observations, we would have to wait for a long time (a decade or longer) in order to more meaningfully probe the circumstellar matter of SNe Ia.},

While the X-ray emission of ultra-long GRBs have been studied extensively in the past, no comprehensive radio data set has been obtained so far. We report here the early discovery of an unusual radio afterglow associated with the ultra-long GRB 130925A. The radio emission peaks at low-frequencies (\~{}7 GHz) at early times, only 2.2 days after the burst occurred. More notably, the radio spectrum at frequencies above 10 GHz exhibits a rather steep cut-off, compared to other long GRB radio afterglows. This cut-off can be explained if the emitting electrons are either mono-energetic or originate from a rather steep, dN/dE ? E-4, power-law energy distribution. An alternative electron acceleration mechanism may be required to produce such an electron energy distribution. Furthermore, the radio spectrum exhibits a secondary underlying and slowly varying component. This may hint that the radio emission we observed is comprised of emission from both a reverse and a forward shock. We discuss our results in comparison with previous works that studied the unusual X-ray spectrum of this event and discuss the implications of our findings on progenitor scenarios.},

Each primary condensation contains of the order of io galaxies, which in the main expand apart from each other as the universe expands.

Runs of this code with "example" shock patterns show that both the appearance of superluminal VLBI sources and the characteristics of the total and polarized flux evolution of variable compact sources may be understood in terms of one shock, or a sequence of closely spaced shocks, propagating along a diverging flow. We argue that multiple-shock events may be a common feature of such sources. The interpretation of VLBI maps is discussed. We note that, in this model, the "core-knot" separation is frequency-dependent, the knot may sometimes be brighter than the core, and, because of the multiplicity of components, infrequent mapping can lead to apparent contractions and accelerations.},

This analysis has provided a good estimate of characteristic time scales of variability for the two types of object: there is a very broad distribution of time scales for both BL Lac objects and QSOs with mean time scales of 1.95 and 2.35 yr, respectively. The majority of sources ({\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}85\%) with time scales greater than 10 yr are QSOs. A structure function analysis applied to the Stokes parameters in a frame of reference related to the VLBI jet structure suggests that variations of the polarized flux occur in an orientation related to the underlying jet direction. This is further circumstantial evidence for the domination of the source polarization by a shock phenomenon, as this behavior is what one would expect from the axial compression of a turbulent magnetic field. We interpret our derived time scales for Q and U variations and the relative amplitude of these variations, in terms of emission from shocked jets with a well-defined magnetic field direction, contaminated by a significant but randomly polarized core emission for BL Lacs, and in similar terms, but with a magnetic field less strongly correlated with the jet direction, and a weakly polarized core, for QSOs. Periodogram analyses show little or no evidence of harmonic behavior. Subject Headings BL Lacertae objects: general - galaxies: jets - polarization - quasars: general - radio continuum: galaxies},

The radio periodicity occurs at the longest period yet found, 2.9 hr, and was discovered in archival low-frequency data from the Murchison Widefield Array. High time resolution observations from MeerKAT show that pulsations from the source display complex microstructure and high linear polarisation, suggesting a pulsar-like emission mechanism occurring due to strong, ordered magnetic fields. The timing residuals, measured over more than a decade, show tentative evidence of a \~{}6 yr modulation.

	abstract = {Several long-period radio transients have recently been discovered, with strongly polarized coherent radio pulses appearing on timescales between tens to thousands of seconds1,2. In some cases, the radio pulses have been interpreted as coming from rotating neutron stars with extremely strong magnetic fields, known as magnetars; the origin of other, occasionally periodic and less-well-sampled radio transients is still debated3. Coherent periodic radio emission is usually explained by rotating dipolar magnetic fields and pair-production mechanisms, but such models do not easily predict radio emission from such slowly rotating neutron stars and maintain it for extended times. On the other hand, highly magnetic isolated white dwarfs would be expected to have long spin periodicities, but periodic coherent radio emission has not yet been directly detected from these sources. Here we report observations of a long-period (21 min) radio transient, which we have labelled GPM J1839-10. The pulses vary in brightness by two orders of magnitude, last between 30 and 300 s and have quasiperiodic substructure. The observations prompted a search of radio archives and we found that the source has been repeating since at least 1988. The archival data enabled constraint of the period derivative to {\textless}3.6 {\texttimes} 10-13 s s-1, which is at the very limit of any classical theoretical model that predicts dipolar radio emission from an isolated neutron star.},

The low-frequency band, however, is sensitive to exotic coherent and polarized radio-emission processes, such as electron-cyclotron maser emission from flaring M dwarfs1, stellar magnetospheric plasma interactions with exoplanets2 and a population of steep-spectrum pulsars3, making Galactic-plane searches a prospect for blind-transient discovery. Here we report an analysis of archival low-frequency radio data that reveals a periodic, low-frequency radio transient. We find that the source pulses every 18.18 min, an unusual periodicity that has, to our knowledge, not been observed previously. The emission is highly linearly polarized, bright, persists for 30-60 s on each occurrence and is visible across a broad frequency range. At times, the pulses comprise short-duration ({\textless}0.5 s) bursts; at others, a smoother profile is observed. These profiles evolve on timescales of hours. By measuring the dispersion of the radio pulses with respect to frequency, we have localized the source to within our own Galaxy and suggest that it could be an ultra-long-period magnetar.},

It was discovered in a 330 MHz VLA observation from 2002 September 30-October 1 and subsequently rediscovered in a 330 MHz GMRT observation from 2003 September 28 by Hyman et al. Here we report a new radio detection of the source in 330 MHz GMRT data taken on 2004 March 20. The observed properties of the single burst detected differ significantly from those measured previously. The 2004 flux density was {\textasciitilde}0.05 Jy, {\textasciitilde}10{\texttimes} weaker than the single 2003 burst and {\textasciitilde}30{\texttimes} weaker than the five bursts detected in 2002. We derive a very steep spectral index, $\alpha$=-13.5+/-3.0, across the bandpass, a new result previously not obtained in the 2002 and 2003 observations. Also, the burst was detected for only {\textasciitilde}2 minutes, in contrast to the {\textasciitilde}10 minute duration observed in the earlier bursts. Due to sparse sampling, only the single burst was detected in 2004, as in the 2003 epoch, and we cannot completely rule out additional undetected bursts that may have occurred with the same {\textasciitilde}77 minute periodicity observed in 2002 or with a different periodicity. Considering our total time on source throughout both our archival and active monitoring campaigns, we estimate the source exhibits detectable bursting activity {\textasciitilde}7\% of the time.},

The source was detected 10 times from late 2006 to 2007 May in our 235 MHz transient monitoring program with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT). The radio emission brightened in about one month, reaching a peak observed flux density of {\textasciitilde}100 mJy on 2007 January 28, and decaying to {\textasciitilde}50 mJy by 2007 May when our last monitoring observation was made. Two additional faint, isolated 235 MHz detections were made in mid-2006, also with the GMRT. GCRT J1742-3001 is unresolved at each epoch, with typical resolutions of {\textasciitilde}20'' {\texttimes} 10''. No polarization information is available from the observations. Based on nondetections in observations obtained simultaneously at 610 MHz, we deduce that the spectrum of GCRT J1742-3001 is very steep, with a spectral index less than about -2. Follow-up radio observations in 2007 September at 330 MHz and 1.4 GHz, and in 2008 February at 235 MHz yielded no detections. No X-ray counterpart is detected in a serendipitous observation obtained with the X-ray telescope aboard the Swift satellite during the peak of the radio emission in early 2007. We consider the possibilities that GCRT J1742-3001 is either a new member of an existing class of radio transients, or is representative of a new class, possibly having no associated X-ray emission.},

Although high-time-resolution observations are often possible in radio astronomy, they are usually limited to quite narrow fields of view. The dynamic radio sky is therefore poorly sampled, in contrast to the situation in the X-ray and $\gamma$-ray bands in which wide-field instruments routinely detect transient sources. Here we report a transient radio source, GCRT J1745-3009, which was detected during a moderately wide-field monitoring programme of the Galactic Centre region at 0.33GHz. The characteristics of its bursts are unlike those known for any other class of radio transient. If located in or near the Galactic Centre, its brightness temperature ({\textasciitilde}1016K) and the implied energy density within GCRT J1745-3009 vastly exceed those observed in most other classes of radio astronomical sources, and are consistent with coherent emission processes that are rarely observed. We conclude that it represents a hitherto unknown class of transient radio sources, the first of possibly many new classes that may be discovered by emerging wide-field radio telescopes.},

	abstract = {The identification of persistent radio sources (PRSs) coincident with two repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) supports FRB theories requiring a compact central engine. However, deep nondetections in other cases highlight the diversity of repeating FRBs and their local environments. Here, we perform a systematic search for radio sources towards 37 CHIME/FRB repeaters using their arcminute localizations and a combination of archival surveys and targeted observations. Through multiwavelength analysis of individual radio sources, we identify two (20181030A-S1 and 20190417A-S1) for which we disfavor an origin of either star formation or an active galactic nucleus in their host galaxies and thus consider them candidate PRSs. We do not find any associated PRSs for the majority of the repeating FRBs in our sample. For eight FRB fields with Very Large Array imaging, we provide deep limits on the presence of PRSs that are 2{\textendash}4 orders of magnitude fainter than the PRS associated with FRB 20121102A. Using Very Large Array Sky Survey imaging of all 37 fields, we constrain the rate of luminous (?1040 erg s-1) PRSs associated with repeating FRBs to be low. Within the context of FRB-PRS models, we find that 20181030A-S1 and 20190417A-S1 can be reasonably explained within the context of magnetar, hypernebulae, gamma-ray burst afterglow, or supernova ejecta models{\textemdash}although we note that both sources follow the radio luminosity versus rotation measure relationship predicted in the nebula model framework. Future observations will be required to both further characterize and confirm the association of these PRS candidates with the FRBs.},

	abstract = {We present the first full release of a survey of the 150 MHz radio sky, observed with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) between April 2010 and March 2012 as part of the TIFR GMRT Sky Survey (TGSS) project. Aimed at producing a reliable compact source survey, our automated data reduction pipeline efficiently processed more than 2000 h of observations with minimal human interaction. Through application of innovative techniques such as image-based flagging, direction-dependent calibration of ionospheric phase errors, correcting for systematic offsets in antenna pointing, and improving the primary beam model, we created good quality images for over 95 percent of the 5336 pointings. Our data release covers 36 900 deg2 (or 3.6 $\pi$ steradians) of the sky between -53{\textdegree} and +90{\textdegree} declination (Dec), which is 90 percent of the total sky. The majority of pointing images have a noise level below 5 mJy beam-1 with an approximate resolution of 25''{\texttimes}25'' (or 25''{\texttimes}25''/ cos(Dec-19{\textdegree}) for pointings south of 19{\textdegree} declination). We have produced a catalog of 0.62 Million radio sources derived from an initial, high reliability source extraction at the seven sigma level. For the bulk of the survey, the measured overall astrometric accuracy is better than two arcseconds in right ascension and declination, while the flux density accuracy is estimated at approximately ten percent. Within the scope of the TGSS alternative data release (TGSS ADR) project, the source catalog, as well as 5336 mosaic images (5{\textdegree}{\texttimes}5{\textdegree}) and an image cutout service, are made publicly available at the CDS as a service to the astronomical community. Next to enabling a wide range of different scientific investigations, we anticipate that these survey products will provide a solid reference for various new low-frequency radio aperture array telescopes (LOFAR, LWA, MWA, SKA-low), and can play an important role in characterizing the epoch-of-reionisation (EoR) foreground. The TGSS ADR project aims at continuously improving the quality of the survey data products. Near-future improvements include replacement of bright source snapshot images with archival targeted observations, using new observations to fill the holes in sky coverage and replace very poor quality observational data, and an improved flux calibration strategy for less severely affected observational data.

	abstract = {We discuss two important instability mechanisms that may lead to the limit-cycle oscillations of the luminosity of the accretion discs around compact objects: ionization instability and radiation pressure instability. Ionization instability is well established as a mechanism of X-ray novae eruptions in black hole binary systems, but its applicability to active galactic nuclei (AGN) is still problematic. Radiation pressure theory has still a very weak observational background in any of these sources. In this paper, we attempt to confront the parameter space of these instabilities with the observational data. At the basis of this simple survey of sources properties, we argue that the radiation pressure instability is likely to be present in several Galactic sources with the Eddington ratios being above 0.15 and in AGN with the Eddington ratio above 0.025. Our results favour the parametrization of the viscosity through the geometrical mean of the radiation and gas pressure in both Galactic sources and AGN. More examples of the quasi-regular outbursts in the time-scales of 100 s in Galactic sources and hundreds of years in AGN are needed to formulate firm conclusions. We also show that the disc sizes in the X-ray novae are consistent with the ionization instability. This instability may also considerably influence the lifetime cycle and overall complexity in the supermassive black hole environment.},

	abstract = {We present a study of the spectral properties of 441 pulsars observed with the Parkes radio telescope near the centre frequencies of 728, 1382 and 3100 MHz. The observations at 728 and 3100 MHz were conducted simultaneously using the dual-band 10-50 cm receiver. These high-sensitivity, multifrequency observations provide a systematic and uniform sample of pulsar flux densities. We combine our measurements with spectral data from the literature in order to derive the spectral properties of these pulsars. Using techniques from robust regression and information theory, we classify the observed spectra in an objective, robust and unbiased way into five morphological classes: simple or broken power law, power law with either low- or high-frequency cut-off and log-parabolic spectrum. While about 79 per cent of the pulsars that could be classified have simple power-law spectra, we find significant deviations in 73 pulsars, 35 of which have curved spectra, 25 with a spectral break and 10 with a low-frequency turn-over. We identify 11 gigahertz-peaked spectrum (GPS) pulsars, with 3 newly identified in this work and 8 confirmations of known GPS pulsars; 3 others show tentative evidence of GPS, but require further low-frequency measurements to support this classification. The weighted mean spectral index of all pulsars with simple power-law spectra is -1.60 {\textpm} 0.03. The observed spectral indices are well described by a shifted log-normal distribution. The strongest correlations of spectral index are with spin-down luminosity, magnetic field at the light-cylinder and spin-down rate. We also investigate the physical origin of the observed spectral features and determine emission altitudes for three pulsars.},

Using the total far-infrared luminosity of all {\textgreater}5$\sigma$ sources in the Herschel-ATLAS Science Demonstration Field and cross-matching these data with radio data from the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-Centimetres (FIRST) survey and the NRAO Very Large Array (VLA) Northern Sky Survey (NVSS), we obtain 104 radio counterparts to the Herschel sources. With these data we find no evidence for evolution in the far-infrared-radio correlation over the redshift range 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.5, where the median value for the ratio between far-infrared and radio luminosity, qIR, over this range is qIR = 2.40 +/- 0.12 (and a mean of qIR = 2.52 +/- 0.03 accounting for the lower limits), consistent with both the local value determined from IRAS and values derived from surveys targeting the high-redshift Universe. By comparing the radio fluxes of our sample measured from both FIRST and NVSS we show that previous results suggesting an increase in the value of qIR from high to low redshift may be the result of resolving out extended emission of the low-redshift sources with relatively high-resolution interferometric data, although contamination from active galactic nuclei could still play a significant role. We also find tentative evidence that the longer wavelength cooler dust is heated by an evolved stellar population which does not trace the star formation rate as closely as the shorter wavelength {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 250$\mu$m emission or the radio emission, supporting suggestions based on detailed models of individual galaxies.

The Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) is a technology demonstrator aimed in the mid-frequency range, and achieves instantaneous wide-area imaging through the development and deployment of phased-array feed systems on parabolic reflectors. The large field-of-view makes ASKAP an unprecedented synoptic telescope that will make substantial advances in SKA key science. ASKAP will be located at the Murchison Radio Observatory in inland Western Australia, one of the most radio-quiet locations on the Earth and one of two sites selected by the international community as a potential location for the SKA. In this paper, we outline an ambitious science program for ASKAP, examining key science such as understanding the evolution, formation and population of galaxies including our own, understanding the magnetic Universe, revealing the transient radio sky and searching for gravitational waves.},

	abstract = {Context. M-dwarf stars are the most numerous stars in the Galaxy, and are highly magnetically active. They exhibit bursts of radiation and matter, called flares and coronal mass ejections which have the potential to strongly affect the habitability of their planets. Aims: We investigate variability through simultaneous optical and X-ray observations, forming the largest statistical sample of M dwarfs observed in this way so far. Such simultaneous observations at different wavelengths, which correspond to emissions from different layers of the stellar atmosphere, are required to constrain the flare frequency and energetics and to understand the physics of flares. Methods: We used light curves from the extended ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) on board the Russian Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma mission (SRG) and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) for a sample of M dwarfs observed simultaneously with both instruments. Specifically, we identified 256 M dwarfs in the TESS Southern Continuous Viewing Zone (SCVZ), which corresponds to a sky area of 452.39 (deg2), with simultaneous TESS and eROSITA detection. For this work, we selected the 25 X-ray brightest or most X-ray variable stars. We used photometric data from Ga{\`i}a and 2MASS to obtain stellar parameters such as distances, colours, masses, radii, and bolometric luminosities. X-ray fluxes and luminosities were determined from observed eROSITA count rates using appropriate rate-to-flux conversion factors. We defined and examined various variability diagnostics in both wavebands and how these parameters are related to each other. Results: Our stars are nearby (mostly within {\textasciitilde}100 pc), rotating fast (Prot {\textless} 9 d), and display a high optical flare frequency, as expected from the selection of particularly X-ray-active objects. The optical duty cycle - defined as the fraction of observing time in which the stars were in a high activity state - is well correlated with the optical flare rate and was therefore used as proxy for optical variability. The X-ray and optical duty cycles are positively correlated, and there is a trend of faster rotators tending to have higher X-ray and optical variability. For stars with many X-ray flaring events, the chances of these events being found together with optical flares are high. A quantitative variability study of individual flares in the X-ray light curves is severely affected by data gaps due to the low (4h) cadence during the eROSITA all-sky survey. To mitigate this, we made use of the optical flares observed with TESS combined with knowledge accumulated from solar flares to put additional constraints on the peak flux and timing of X-ray events. With this method we could perform an exponential fit to 17 X-ray light curves in the aftermath of an optical flare, and we find that the energies for these X-ray flares are well correlated with the corresponding optical flare energy. We also found two peculiar flaring events with uncharacteristically long duration and high energies observed in both their X-ray and optical light curves. Conclusions: Despite the substantial uncertainties associated with our analysis, which are mostly related to the poor sampling of the eROSITA light curves, our results showcase in an exemplary way the relevance of simultaneous all-sky surveys in different wavebands for obtaining unprecedented quantitative information on stellar variability.

	abstract = {The scattering structures in the interstellar medium responsible for so-called extreme scattering events (ESEs), observed in quasars and pulsars, remain enigmatic. Current models struggle to explain the high-frequency light curves of ESEs, and a recent analysis of a double lensing event in PSR B0834+06 reveals features of ESEs that may also be challenging to accommodate via existing models. We propose that these features arise naturally when the lens has a cusp-like profile, described by the elementary A3 cusp catastrophe. This is an extension of previous work describing pulsar scintillation as arising from A2 fold catastrophes in thin, corrugated plasma sheets along the line of sight. We call this framework of describing the lens potentials via elementary catastrophes 'doubly catastrophic lensing', as catastrophes (e.g. folds and cusps) have long been used to describe universal features in the light curves of lensing events that generically manifest, regardless of the precise details of the lens. Here, we argue that the lenses themselves may be described by these same elementary structures. If correct, the doubly catastrophic lensing framework would provide a unified description of scintillation and ESEs, where the lenses responsible for these scattering phenomena are universal and can be fully described by a small number of unfolding parameters. This could enable their application as giant cosmic lenses for precision measurements of coherent sources, including fast radio bursts and pulsars.},

	abstract = {Astrophysical lensing has typically been studied in two regimes: diffractive optics and refractive optics. Previously, it has been assumed that the Fresnel scale, RF, is the relevant physical scale that separates these two regimes. With the recent introduction of Picard-Lefschetz theory to the field of lensing, it has become possible to generalize the refractive description of discrete images to all wave parameters, and, in particular, exactly evaluate the diffraction integral at all frequencies. In this work, we assess the regimes of validity of refractive and diffractive approximations for a simple one-dimensional lens model through comparison with this exact evaluation. We find that, contrary to previous assumptions, the true separation scale between these regimes is given by \$R\_F/{\textbackslash}sqrt\{{\textbackslash}kappa \}\$, where $\kappa$ is the convergence of the lens. Thus, when the lens is strong, refractive optics can hold for arbitrarily small scales. We also argue that intensity variations in diffractive optics are generically small, which has implications for the study of strong diffractive interstellar scintillation.},

After rejecting intrinsic, instrumental, and ionospheric origins we consider the most likely explanation for this variability to be interplanetary scintillation (IPS), likely the result of a large coronal mass ejection propagating from the Sun. This is confirmed by roughly contemporaneous observations with the Ooty Radio Telescope. We see evidence for structure on spatial scales ranging from {\textless}1000 to \{10\}6 km. The serendipitous night-time nature of these detections illustrates the new regime that the MWA has opened for IPS studies with sensitive night-time, wide-field, low-frequency observations. This regime complements traditional dedicated strategies for observing IPS and can be utilized in real-time to facilitate dedicated follow-up observations. At the same time, it allows large-scale surveys for compact (arcsec) structures in low-frequency radio sources despite the 2{\textbackslash}prime resolution of the array.},

We found only a single marginal candidate, limiting the presence of any late-type star to {\textgreater}1 kpc (spectral types earlier than M9), {\textgreater}200 pc (spectral types L and T0-T4), and {\textgreater}100 pc (spectral types T4-T7), thus severely restricting the possible local counterparts to GCRT J1745-3009. We also exclude any white dwarf within 1 kpc or a supergiant star out to the distance of the Galactic center as possible counterparts.

We show that the flux density spectra of both populations are similarly steep, and the widths of MSP profiles obey the same dependence on the rotational period as slow pulsars. We also show that the polarization of MSPs has similar properties to slow pulsars. The commonly used pseudo-luminosity of pulsars, defined as the product of the flux density and the distance squared, is not appropriate for drawing conclusions about the relative intrinsic radio luminosity of SPs and MSPs. We show that it is possible to scale the pseudo-luminosity to account for the pulse duty cycle and the solid angle of the radio beam, in such a way that MSPs and SPs do not show clear differences in intrinsic luminosity. The data therefore support common emission physics between the two populations in spite of orders of magnitude difference in their period derivatives and inferred, surface, dipole magnetic field strengths.},

For magnetars with parameters in this range, the rotational energy is released on a timescale of days to weeks, which is comparable to the effective diffusion time through the supernova remnant. The late time energy injection can then be radiated without suffering overwhelming adiabatic expansion losses. The magnetar input also produces a central bubble that sweeps ejecta into an internal dense shell, resulting in a prolonged period of nearly constant photospheric velocity in the observed spectra. We derive analytic expressions for the light curve rise time and peak luminosity as a function of B and Pi , and the properties of the supernova ejecta that allow for direct inferences about the underlying magnetar in bright supernovae. We perform numerical radiation hydrodynamic calculations of a few specific instances and compare the resulting light curves to observed events. Magnetar birth is likely to impact more than a few percent of all core-collapse supernovae, and may naturally explain some of the brightest events ever seen (e.g., SN 2005ap and SN 2008es) at L {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 1044 ergs s-1.},

Four pulsars, including the Vela pulsar, have observed time scales that are in poor agreement with theoretical predictions. Pulsars predicted to have extremely long refractive scintillation time scales are observed to have stable fluxes. These pulsars therefore have intrinsically stable luminosities.

The population of detected magnetars has grown to about 30 objects and shows unambiguous phenomenological connection with highly magnetized radio pulsars.

This may be explained if it is a white dwarf pulsar, with a moment of inertia several orders of magnitude greater than those of neutron stars. The Lorentz factor of the emitting charge bunches may be bounded from below by the widths of the temporal substructure of their radiation.

Nearly 70 of these objects have been found over the past several years in archival and new pulsar surveys. In this review, we describe these searches and their resulting discoveries. We then discuss radio timing algorithms and the spin-down properties of the 19 RRATs with phase-connected solutions. The spin-down parameters fall within the same range as other pulsars, with a tendency towards longer periods and higher magnetic fields. Next we describe follow-up observations at radio wavelengths. These show that there are periodic fluctuations in the pulse detection rates of some RRATs and that RRATs in general have similar spectra to other pulsars. X-ray detection has only been made for one RRAT, J1819-1458; observations have revealed absorption features and a bright X-ray nebula. Finally, we look to future telescopes and the progress that will be made with these in characterising and understanding the Galactic RRAT population.},

Furthermore, we announce the discovery of seven new transient sources, one of which may be extragalactic in origin (with z\~{} 0.1) and would then be a second example of the so-called 'Lorimer burst'. The timing solutions allow us to infer neutron star characteristics such as energy-loss rate, magnetic field strength and evolutionary time-scales, as well as facilitating multiwavelength followup by providing accurate astrometry. All of this enables us to consider the question of whether or not RRATs are in any way special, i.e. a distinct and separate population of neutron stars, as has been previously suggested. We see no reason to consider 'RRAT' as anything other than a detection label, the subject of a selection effect in the parameter space searched. However, single-pulse searches can be utilized to great effect to identify pulsars difficult, or impossible, to find by other means, in particular those with long periods (half of the PMPS RRATs have periods greater than 4 s), high magnetic field strengths (B? 1013 G) and pulsars approaching the 'death valley'. The detailed nulling properties of such pulsars are unknown but the mounting evidence suggests a broad range of behaviour in the pulsar population. The group of RRATs fits in to the picture where pulsar magnetospheres switch between stable configurations.},

We find significant DM and RM variations in 87 and 76 pulsars, respectively. We find that the DM variations scale approximately linearly with DM, which is broadly in agreement with models of the ionized interstellar medium. The observed RM variations seem largely independent of DM, which may suggest that the RM variations are dominated by variations in the interstellar magnetic field on the line of sight, rather than varying electron density. We also find that normal pulsars have around 5 times greater amplitude of DM variability compared to millisecond pulsars, and surmise that this is due to the known difference in their velocity distributions.},

Strong, generally double-sided radio emission spanning {\textbackslash}gg 10 \{kpc\} was found to be associated with 13 of the 18 RLQ cores with peak flux densities of \{S\}\{\{p\}\}{\textgreater} 5 \{mJy\} \{\{beam\}\}-1 (\{log\}(L)? 24). The radio luminosity function of optically selected QSOs and the extended radio emission associated with RLQs are both inconsistent with simple {\textquotedblleft}unified{\textquotedblright} models that invoke relativistic beaming from randomly oriented QSOs to explain the difference between RLQs and RQQs. Some intrinsic property of the AGNs or their host galaxies must also determine whether or not a QSO appears radio-loud.},

The new radio observations typically reach a level of 0. 1 in the ratio R of radio-to-optical luminosity which allow radio emission to be detected from most of the BQS objects. Ninety six (84\%) of the BQS were detected as radio sources above a 3 $\sigma$ level of 0.2 mJy, and 75 (82\%) of the complete sample of 92 quasars with M\_B\_ {\textless} -23 were detected. There appears to be no difference in the radio properties of AGNs (M\_B\_ {\textgreater} 23) and quasars (M\_B\_ {\textless} 23). The distribution of radio flux density for the BQS sample appears bimodal. Most of the BQS quasars are "radio quiet" and have a radio flux density close to that of the optical flux density, but 15\% - 20\% are "radio loud" and are much brighter at radio than at optical wavelengths. Only a few percent of the BQS sample overlap radio-selected quasars in the ratio of radio-to-optical flux density. Most of the sources detected with 18 arcsec resolution were reobserved with a resolution of 0.5 arcsec. For the optically selected quasars, we find an increasing fraction of compact sources with increasing redshift. We derive the radio luminosity function, assuming that it is either (a) independent of optical luminosity, or (b) a function of the ratio R of radio-to-optical luminosity. The statistics of radio detections of optically selected quasars in this and in other published studies are equally well represented by the two cases. The radio emission from high-redshift quasars (z {\textgreater} 0.5) is dominated by compact components; quasars with R {\textgreater} 100 mostly have small redshifts. The distinction between the radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars from this optically selected sample cannot be explained simply by the effects of geometry and relativistic beaming for objects having a fixed ratio of intrinsic radio and optical luminosity.},

We detect a compact core at 1.6 and 8.4 GHz using new Very Long Baseline Array observations, finding no significant extended, jet-like features down to \~{}1 pc scales. The flat spectral index ($\alpha$ \_\{1.6\}{\textasciicircum}\{8.4\} = 0.03) and high brightness temperature (Tb \~{} 108 K) indicate self-absorbed synchrotron emission from the AGN. The radio to X-ray luminosity ratio of log(LR/LX) \~{} -5, similar to that in coronally active stars, suggests emission from magnetized coronal winds, although unresolved radio jets are also consistent with the data. Comparing new Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array measurements with archival and published radio flux densities, we find 46 per cent, 34 per cent, and (insignificantly) 13 per cent flux density decreases between the 1990s and the year 2015 at 1.4 GHz, 5 GHz and 8.4 GHz, respectively. This trend, possibly due to the expansion and fading of internal shocks within the radio-emitting outflow after a recent outburst, is consistent with the decline of the optical-UV and X-ray luminosities over the same period. Such correlated variability demonstrates the AGN accretion-outflow connection, confirming that the changing-look behaviour in Mrk 590 originates from variable accretion rates rather than dust obscuration. The present radio and X-ray luminosity correlation, consistent with low/hard state accretion, suggests that the black hole may now be accreting in a radiatively inefficient mode.},

	abstract = {Stars in the immediate vicinity of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) can be ripped apart by the tidal forces of the black hole. The subsequent accretion of the stellar material causes a spectacular flare of electromagnetic radiation. Here, we provide a review of the observations of tidal disruption events (TDEs), with an emphasis on the important contributions of Swift to this field. TDEs represent a new probe of matter under strong gravity, and have opened up a new window into studying accretion physics under extreme conditions. The events probe relativistic effects, provide a new means of measuring black hole spin, and represent signposts of intermediate-mass BHs, binary BHs and recoiling BHs. Luminous, high-amplitude X-ray flares, matching key predictions of the tidal disruption scenario, have first been discovered with ROSAT, and more recently with other missions and in other wavebands. The Swift discovery of two $\gamma$-ray emitting, jetted TDEs, never seen before, has provided us with a unique probe of the early phases of jet formation and evolution, and Swift J1644+75 has the best covered lightcurve of any TDE to date. Further, Swift has made important contributions in providing well-covered lightcurves of TDEs discovered with other instruments, setting constraints on the physics that govern the TDE evolution, and including the discovery of the first candidate binary SMBH identified from a TDE lightcurve. In X-rays, TDEs probe relativistic effects (via emission-line profiles or precession effects in the Kerr metric) and the extremes of accretion physics at high rates and near the last stable orbit, and provide us with a new means of measuring BH spin. Jetted TDEs provide new insight into the formation and early evolution of radio jets, and may shed new light on related issues like the cause of the radio-loud radio-quiet dichotomy of active galactic nuclei (AGN). TDEs, once detected in large numbers, will unveil the population of IMBHs in the universe. TDE rates depend on, and therefore trace, stellar dynamics in galaxy cores on spatial scales which cannot be resolved directly. TDEs are signposts of binary SMBHs and recoiling BHs, because their rates are strongly enhanced under these conditions, and TDEs will occur off-nuclear if the SMBH is recoiling. TDEs in gas-rich environments will illuminate the circum-nuclear material, so that the reprocessed emission lines and their temporal evolution provide us with an unparalleled opportunity of reverberation mapping the cores of quiescent galaxies. Here, we present an overview of the status of observations of TDEs, highlighting the important role plaid by the Swift mission (Gehrels et al., 2004; Gehrels and Cannizzo, in press). An accompanying review by Lodato (in press) will focus on theoretical aspects of tidal disruption.},

	abstract = {Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are thermonuclear explosions of degenerate white dwarf stars destabilized by mass accretion from a companion star1, but the nature of their progenitors remains poorly understood. A way to discriminate between progenitor systems is through radio observations; a non-degenerate companion star is expected to lose material through winds2 or binary interaction3 before explosion, and the supernova ejecta crashing into this nearby circumstellar material should result in radio synchrotron emission. However, despite extensive efforts, no type Ia supernova (SN Ia) has ever been detected at radio wavelengths, which suggests a clean environment and a companion star that is itself a degenerate white dwarf star4,5. Here we report on the study of SN 2020eyj, a SN Ia showing helium-rich circumstellar material, as demonstrated by its spectral features, infrared emission and, for the first time in a SN Ia to our knowledge, a radio counterpart. On the basis of our modelling, we conclude that the circumstellar material probably originates from a single-degenerate binary system in which a white dwarf accretes material from a helium donor star, an often proposed formation channel for SNe Ia (refs. 6,7). We describe how comprehensive radio follow-up of SN 2020eyj-like SNe Ia can improve the constraints on their progenitor systems.},

The data were obtained over a period of 8.5 months in 2001 with the Multi Element Radio-Linked Interferometer Network (MERLIN) at 5 GHz with 50 mas resolution, as part of a MERLIN Key Project. Even though the time delays between the fold and cusp images are small ({\textless}{\textasciitilde}1 day) compared to the timescale of intrinsic source variability, all six lens systems show evidence that suggests the presence of extrinsic variability. In particular, the cusp images of B2045+265-regarded as the strongest case of the violation of the cusp relation (i.e., the sum of the magnifications of the three cusp images add to zero)-show extrinsic variations in their flux ratios up to {\textasciitilde}40\% peak to peak on timescales of several months. Its low Galactic latitude of b{\textasciitilde}-10deg and a line of sight toward the Cygnus superbubble region suggest that Galactic scintillation is the most likely cause. The cusp images of B1422+231 at b{\textasciitilde}+69deg do not show strong extrinsic variability. Galactic scintillation can therefore cause significant scatter in the cusp and fold relations of some radio lens systems (up to 10\% rms), even though these relations remain violated when averaged over a {\textless}{\textasciitilde}1 yr time baseline.},

	abstract = {We present the first unambiguous case of external variability of a radio gravitational lens, CLASS B1600+434. The Very Large Array (VLA) 8.5-GHz difference light curve of the lensed images, taking the proper time-delay into account, shows the presence of external variability with 14.6-sigma confidence. We investigate two plausible causes of this external variability: scattering by the ionized component of the Galactic interstellar medium and microlensing by massive compact objects in the bulge/disk and halo of the lens galaxy. Based on the tight relation between the modulation-index (fractional rms variability) and variability time scale and the quantitative difference between the light curves of both lensed images, we conclude that the observed short-term variability characteristics of the lensed images are incompatible with scintillation in our Galaxy. This conclusion is strongly supported by multi-frequency Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) observations at 1.4 and 5 GHz, which are in disagreement with predictions based on the scintillation hypothesis. Several arguments against scintillation might need to be reevaluated if evidence is found for significant scatter-broadening of lensed image B seen through the lens galaxy. However, the frequency-dependence and time scale of variability from image A are not affected by this and remain strong arguments against scintillation. On the other hand, a single superluminal jet-component in the source, having an apparent velocity 9la (v\_app/c)la 26, a radius of 2-5 mu as and containing 5-11\% of the observed 8.5-GHz source flux density, can reproduce the observed modulation-indices and variability time scale at 8.5 GHz, when it is microlensed by compact objects in the lens galaxy. It also reproduces the frequency-dependence of the modulation-indices, determined from the independent WSRT 1.4 and 5-GHz observations. The difference between the modulation-indices of the lensed images (i.e. 2.8\% and 1.6\% at 8.5 GHz in 1998 for images A and B, respectively), if not affected by scatter-broadening of image B by the ionized ISM of the lens galaxy, can be explained through a different mass-function for the compact objects in the bulge/disk and halo of the lens galaxy. Comparing the observations with microlensing simulations, we place a tentative lower limit of ga 0.5 M\_sun on the average mass of compact objects in the halo line-of-sight. The above-mentioned set of mass-function and source parameters is consistent, although not unique, and should only be regarded as indicative. The only conclusion fully consistent with the data gathered thus far is that we have indeed detected radio microlensing. The far reaching consequence of this statement is that a significant fraction of the mass in the dark-matter halo at {\textasciitilde} 6 kpc (h=0.65) above the lens-galaxy disk in B1600+434 consists of massive compact objects.},

However, when the radio emission ceases, it switches off in less than 10 seconds and remains undetectable for the next 25 to 35 days, then switches on again. This pattern repeats quasi-periodically. The origin of this behavior is unclear. Even more remarkably, the pulsar rotation slows down 50\% faster when it is on than when it is off. This indicates a massive increase in magnetospheric currents when the pulsar switches on, proving that pulsar wind plays a substantial role in pulsar spin-down. This allows us, for the first time, to estimate the magnetospheric currents in a pulsar magnetosphere during the occurrence of radio emission.},

If magnetars, or neutron stars in general, are indeed responsible, sharp empirical constraints on the mechanism producing radio emission are required. Here we report on the detection of polarized quasi-periodic substructure in the emission of all well-studied radio-detected magnetars. A correlation previously seen, relating substructure in pulsed emission of radio-emitting neutron stars to their rotational period, is extended and now shown to span more than six orders of magnitude in pulse period. This behaviour is not only seen in magnetars but in members of all classes of radio-emitting rotating neutron stars, regardless of their evolutionary history, their power source or their inferred magnetic field strength. If magnetars are responsible for FRBs, it supports the idea of being able to infer underlying periods from sub-burst timescales in FRBs.},

Our observations of V1723 Aql span 1-37 GHz in frequency, and we report on data from 14 to 175 days following the time of the nova explosion. The broad frequency coverage and frequent monitoring show that the radio behavior of V1723 Aql does not follow the classic Hubble-flow model of homologous spherically expanding thermal ejecta. The spectra are always at least partially optically thin, and the flux rises on faster timescales than can be reproduced with linear expansion. Therefore, any description of the underlying physical processes must go beyond this simple picture.

	abstract = {We present a generalized estimator for the autocorrelation function, S-ACF, which is an extended version of the standard estimator of the autocorrelation function (ACF). S-ACF is a versatile definition that can robustly and efficiently extract periodicity and signal shape information from a time series, independent of the time sampling and with minimal assumptions about the underlying process. Calculating the autocorrelation of irregularly sampled time series becomes possible by generalizing the lag of the standard estimator of the ACF to a real parameter and introducing the notion of selection and weight functions. We show that the S-ACF reduces to the standard ACF estimator for regularly sampled time series. Using a large number of synthetic time series, we demonstrate that the performance of the S-ACF is as good or better than commonly used Gaussian and rectangular kernel estimators, and is comparable to a combination of interpolation and the standard estimator. We apply the S-ACF to astrophysical data by extracting rotation periods for the spotted star KIC 5110407, and compare our results to Gaussian process (GP) regression and Lomb-Scargle (LS) periodograms. We find that the S-ACF periods typically agree better with those from GP regression than from LS periodograms, especially in cases where there is evolution in the signal shape. The S-ACF has a wide range of potential applications and should be useful in quantitative science disciplines where irregularly sampled time series occur. A PYTHON implementation of the S-ACF is available under the MIT license.},

	abstract = {ASASSN-14li is a recently discovered tidal disruption event with an exceptionally rich data set: spectra and lightcurves in soft X-rays, UV, optical, and radio. To understand its emission properties in all these bands, we have extended our model for post-tidal disruption accretion and photon production to estimate both soft X-ray radiation produced by the {\textquotedblleft}prompt{\textquotedblright} accretion phase and synchrotron emission associated with the bow shock driven through an external medium by the unbound tidal debris, as well as optical and UV light. We find that fiducial values of the stellar mass (1\{M\}? ) and black hole mass (\{10\}6.5\{M\}? ) yield quantitative agreement with the optical/UV luminosity, lightcurve, and color temperature; approximate agreement with the soft X-ray spectrum and lightcurve; and quantitative agreement with the radio luminosity, spectrum, and lightcurve. Equipartition analysis of the radio data implies that the radio-emitting region expands with a constant speed, and its magnitude is comparable to the speed expected for the unbound stellar ejecta. Both facts provide strong support to our model. We find that the disruption event took place in 2014 mid-September. Two independent parameters, the magnitude and logarithmic radial gradient of the ambient gas density near the black hole, must be fit to the data to explain the radio emission; their inferred values are comparable to those found near both Sgr A* and the TDE candidate Swift J1644.},

Disruption of a white dwarf rather than a main-sequence star offers a number of advantages in understanding the multiple, and short, timescales seen in the light curve of this system. In particular, the short internal dynamical timescale of a white dwarf offers a more natural way of understanding the short rise times ({\textasciitilde}100 s) observed. The relatively long intervals between flares ({\textasciitilde}5 {\texttimes} 104 s) may also be readily understood as the period between successive pericenter passages of the remnant white dwarf. In addition, the expected jet power is larger when a white dwarf is disrupted. If this model is correct, the black hole responsible must have a mass {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 105 M ?.},

	abstract = {The bright transient AT2018cow has been unlike any other known type of transient. Its high brightness, rapid rise and decay, and initially nearly featureless spectrum are unprecedented and difficult to explain using models for similar burst sources. We present evidence for faint $\gamma$-ray emission continuing for at least 8 d, and featureless spectra in the ultraviolet bands - both unusual for eruptive sources. The X-ray variability of the source has a burst-like character. The UV-optical spectrum does not show any CNO line but is well described by a blackbody. We demonstrate that a model invoking the tidal disruption of a 0.1-0.4 M\_? helium white dwarf (WD) by a 10{\textasciicircum}5-10{\textasciicircum}6 M\_? black hole located in the outskirts of galaxy Z 137-068 could provide an explanation for most of the characteristics shown in the multiwavelength observations. A blackbody-like emission is emitted from an opaque photosphere, formed by the debris of the WD disruption. Broad features showing up in the optical/infrared spectra in the early stage are probably velocity broadened lines produced in a transient high-velocity outward moving cocoon. The asymmetric optical/infrared lines that appeared at a later stage are emission from an atmospheric layer when it detached from thermal equilibrium with the photosphere, which undergoes more rapid cooling. The photosphere shrinks when its temperature drops, and the subsequent infall of the atmosphere produced asymmetric line profiles. Additionally, a non-thermal jet might be present, emitting X-rays in the 10-150 keV band.},

The wide dispersion measure (DM) range of the pulsar sample and the uniformity of the observing procedure make the data set extremely valuable for studies of flux density variability and the interstellar medium (ISM). Here, we present flux density measurements and modulation indices of these pulsars over this period. We derive the structure function from the light curves and discuss the contributions to it from measurement noise, intrinsic variability, and interstellar scintillation. Despite a large scatter, we show that the modulation index is inversely correlated with DM, and can be generally described by a power law with an index of {\textasciitilde}-0.7 covering DMs from {\textasciitilde}10 to 1000 cm-3 pc. We present refractive time-scales and/or lower limits for a group of 42 pulsars. These often have values significantly different from theoretical expectations, indicating the complex nature of the ISM along individual lines of sight. In particular, local structures and non-Kolmogorov density fluctuations are likely playing important roles in the observed flux density variation of many of these pulsars.},

The observational fact that only a few percent of quasars are radio-loud is still an unresolved issue concerning the understanding of the active galactic nucleus (AGN) population. Here we present a detection of a rapid transition from the radio-quiet to the radio-loud mode in quasar 013815+00 (z = 0.94) which coincides with changes of its UV-optical continuum and the low ionization Mg II broadline. We interpret this as an enhancement of accretion onto a central black hole of about 109 solar masses. As a consequence a new radio-loud AGN was born. Its spectral and morphological properties indicate that it went through the short gigahertz-peaked spectrum phase at the beginning of its activity and has now stabilized its flux density at the level of a few millijansky. The radio morphology of 013815+00 is very compact and we predict that with such short-term jet activity its development will be very slow. The observed luminosity changes of the accretion disk are shorter than the lifetime of the new radio phase in 013815+00.},

These observations allowed us to trace the connection between the arcsecond structure and the radio core of the quasar. The radio morphology of 1045+352 is dominated by a knotty jet showing several bends. We discuss possible scenarios that could explain such a complex morphology: galaxy merger, accretion disk instability, precession of the jet, and jet-cloud interactions. It is possible that we are witnessing an ongoing jet precession in this source due to internal instabilities within the jet flow; however, a dense environment detected in the submillimeter band and an outflowing material suggested by the X-ray absorption could strongly interact with the jet. It is difficult to establish the orientation between the jet axis and the observer in 1045+352 because of the complex structure. Nevertheless, taking into account the most recent inner radio structure, we conclude that the radio jet is oriented close to the line of sight, which can mean that the opening angle of the accretion disk wind can be large in this source. We also suggest that there is no direct correlation between the jet-observer orientation and the possibility of observing BALs.},

	abstract = {GRB 221009A (z = 0.151) is one of the closest known long $\gamma$-ray bursts (GRBs). Its extreme brightness across all electromagnetic wavelengths provides an unprecedented opportunity to study a member of this still-mysterious class of transients in exquisite detail. We present multiwavelength observations of this extraordinary event, spanning 15 orders of magnitude in photon energy from radio to $\gamma$-rays. We find that the data can be partially explained by a forward shock (FS) from a highly collimated relativistic jet interacting with a low-density, wind-like medium. Under this model, the jet's beaming-corrected kinetic energy (E K {\textasciitilde} 4 {\texttimes} 1050 erg) is typical for the GRB population. The radio and millimeter data provide strong limiting constraints on the FS model, but require the presence of an additional emission component. From equipartition arguments, we find that the radio emission is likely produced by a small amount of mass (?6 {\texttimes} 10-7 M ?) moving relativistically ($\Gamma$ ? 9) with a large kinetic energy (?1049 erg). However, the temporal evolution of this component does not follow prescriptions for synchrotron radiation from a single power-law distribution of electrons (e.g., in a reverse shock or two-component jet), or a thermal-electron population, perhaps suggesting that one of the standard assumptions of afterglow theory is violated. GRB 221009A will likely remain detectable with radio telescopes for years to come, providing a valuable opportunity to track the full lifecycle of a powerful relativistic jet.},

By combining our extensive radio observations of the Fermi-Large Area Telescope $\gamma$-ray burst 160509A at z = 1.17 up to 20 days after the burst with Swift X-ray observations and ground-based optical and near-infrared data, we show that the afterglow emission comprises distinct reverse shock and forward shock contributions: the reverse shock emission dominates in the radio band at ?10 days, while the forward shock emission dominates in the X-ray, optical, and near-infrared bands. Through multi-wavelength modeling, we determine a circumburst density of \{n\}0? \{10\}-3 \{\{cm\}\}-3, supporting our previous suggestion that a low-density circumburst environment is conducive to the production of long-lasting reverse shock radiation in the radio band.

	abstract = {We present the discovery of a slowly evolving, extragalactic radio transient, FIRST J141918.9+394036, identified by comparing a catalog of radio sources in nearby galaxies against new observations from the Very Large Array Sky Survey. Analysis of other archival data shows that FIRST J141918.9+394036 faded by a factor of \~{}50 over 23 years, from a flux of \~{}26 mJy at 1.4 GHz in 1993 to an upper limit of 0.4 mJy at 3 GHz in 2017. FIRST J141918.9+394036 is likely associated with the small star-forming galaxy SDSS J141918.81+394035.8 at a redshift z = 0.01957 (d = 87 Mpc), which implies a peak luminosity $\nu$L $\nu$ ? 3 {\texttimes} 1038 erg s-1. If interpreted as an isotropic synchrotron blast wave, the source requires an explosion of kinetic energy \~{}1051 erg some time prior to our first detection in late 1993. This explosion is most likely associated with a long gamma-ray burst (GRB), but the radio source could also be interpreted as the nebula of a newly born magnetar. The radio discovery of either of these phenomena would be unprecedented. Joint consideration of the event light curve, host galaxy, lack of a counterpart GRB, and volumetric rate suggests that FIRST J141918.9+394036 is the afterglow of an off-axis ({\textquotedblleft}orphan{\textquotedblright}) long GRB. The long time baseline of this event offers the best available constraint in afterglow evolution as the bulk of shock-accelerated electrons become non-relativistic. The proximity, age, and precise localization of FIRST J141918.9+394036 make it a key object for understanding the aftermath of rare classes of stellar explosion.},

	abstract = {The first fast radio burst (FRB) to be precisely localized was associated with a luminous persistent radio source (PRS). Recently, a second FRB/PRS association was discovered for another repeating source of FRBs. However, it is not clear what makes FRBs or PRS or how they are related. We compile FRB and PRS properties to consider the population of FRB/PRS sources. We suggest a practical definition for PRS as FRB associations with luminosity greater than 1029 erg s-1 Hz-1 that are not attributed to star formation activity in the host galaxy. We model the probability distribution of the fraction of FRBs with PRS for repeaters and nonrepeaters, showing there is not yet evidence for repeaters to be preferentially associated with PRS. We discuss how FRB/PRS sources may be distinguished by the combination of active repetition and an excess dispersion measure local to the FRB environment. We use CHIME/FRB event statistics to bound the mean per-source repetition rate of FRBs to be between 25 and 440 yr-1. We use this to provide a bound on the density of FRB-emitting sources in the local universe of between 2.2 {\texttimes} 102 and 5.2 {\texttimes} 104 Gpc-3 assuming a pulsar-like beamwidth for FRB emission. This density implies that PRS may comprise as much as 1\% of compact, luminous radio sources detected in the local universe. The cosmic density and phenomenology of PRS are similar to that of the newly discovered, off-nuclear "wandering" active galactic nuclei (AGN). We argue that it is likely that some PRS have already been detected and misidentified as AGN.},

	abstract = {We present the first blind interferometric detection and imaging of a millisecond radio transient with an observation of transient pulsar J0628+0909. We developed a special observing mode of the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array to produce correlated data products (i.e., visibilities and images) on a timescale of 10 ms. Correlated data effectively produce thousands of beams on the sky that can localize sources anywhere over a wide field of view. We used this new observing mode to find and image pulses from the rotating radio transient (RRAT) J0628+0909, improving its localization by two orders of magnitude. Since the location of the RRAT was only approximately known when first observed, we searched for transients using a wide-field detection algorithm based on the bispectrum, an interferometric closure quantity. Over 16 minutes of observing, this algorithm detected one transient offset roughly 1' from its nominal location; this allowed us to image the RRAT to localize it with an accuracy of 1farcs6. With a priori knowledge of the RRAT location, a traditional beam-forming search of the same data found two lower significance pulses. The refined RRAT position excludes all potential multiwavelength counterparts, limiting its optical luminosity to L\_\{i{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}prime \}\}{\textless}1.1{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{31\} erg s-1 and disfavoring source models with luminous neutron stars.},

	abstract = {We present results of a search for late-time radio emission and fast radio bursts (FRBs) from a sample of type-I superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I). We used the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array to observe 10 SLSN-I more than 5 yr old at a frequency of 3 GHz. We searched fast-sampled visibilities for FRBs and used the same data to perform a deep imaging search for late-time radio emission expected in models of magnetar-powered supernovae. No FRBs were found. One SLSN-I, PTF10hgi, is detected in deep imaging, corresponding to a luminosity of 1.2 {\texttimes} 1028 erg s-1. This luminosity, considered with the recent 6 GHz detection of PTF10hgi in Eftekhari et al., supports the interpretation that it is powered by a young, fast-spinning (\~{}ms spin period) magnetar with \~{}15 M ? of partially ionized ejecta. Broadly, our observations are most consistent with SLSNe-I being powered by neutron stars with fast spin periods, although most require more free-free absorption than is inferred for PTF10hgi. We predict that radio observations at higher frequencies or in the near future will detect these systems and begin constraining properties of the young pulsars and their birth environments.},

	abstract = {The binary neutron star (BNS) merger GW170817 was the first astrophysical source detected in gravitational waves and multiwavelength electromagnetic radiation. The almost simultaneous observation of a pulse of gamma rays proved that BNS mergers are associated with at least some short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). However, the gamma-ray pulse was faint, casting doubt on the association of BNS mergers with the luminous, highly relativistic outflows of canonical short GRBs. Here we show that structured jets with a relativistic, energetic core surrounded by slower and less energetic wings produce afterglow emission that brightens characteristically with time, as recently seen in the afterglow of GW170817. Initially, we only see the relatively slow material moving towards us. As time passes, larger and larger sections of the outflow become visible, increasing the luminosity of the afterglow. The late appearance and increasing brightness of the multiwavelength afterglow of GW170817 allow us to constrain the geometry of its ejecta and thus reveal the presence of an off-axis jet pointing about 30{\textdegree} away from Earth. Our results confirm a single origin for BNS mergers and short GRBs: GW170817 produced a structured outflow with a highly relativistic core and a canonical short GRB. We did not see the bright burst because it was beamed away from Earth. However, approximately one in 20 mergers detected in gravitational waves will be accompanied by a bright, canonical short GRB.},

	abstract = {Long-period radio transients are a novel class of astronomical objects characterised by prolonged periods ranging from 18 minutes to 54 minutes. They exhibit highly polarised, coherent, beamed radio emission lasting only 10--100 seconds. The intrinsic nature of these objects is subject to speculation, with highly magnetised white dwarfs and neutron stars being the prevailing candidates. Here we present ASKAP J183950.5-075635.0 (hereafter, ASKAP J1839-0756), boasting the longest known period of this class at 6.45 hours. It exhibits emission characteristics of an ordered dipolar magnetic field, with pulsar-like bright main pulses and weaker interpulses offset by about half a period are indicative of an oblique or orthogonal rotator. This phenomenon, observed for the first time in a long-period radio transient, confirms that the radio emission originates from both magnetic poles and that the observed period corresponds to the rotation period. The spectroscopic and polarimetric properties of ASKAP J1839-0756 are consistent with a neutron star origin, and this object is a crucial piece of evidence in our understanding of long-period radio sources and their links to neutron stars.},

	abstract = {We present a search for radio afterglows from long gamma-ray bursts using the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP). Our search used the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey, covering the entire celestial sphere south of declination +41o, and three epochs of the Variables and Slow Transients Pilot Survey (Phase 1), covering {\textasciitilde}5000 square degrees per epoch. The observations we used from these surveys spanned a nine-month period from 2019 April 21 to 2020 January 11. We cross-matched radio sources found in these surveys with 779 well-localized (to <=15 arcsec) long gamma-ray bursts occurring after 2004 and determined whether the associations were more likely afterglow- or host-related through the analysis of optical images. In our search, we detected one radio afterglow candidate associated with GRB 171205A, a local low-luminosity gamma-ray burst with a supernova counterpart SN 2017iuk, in an ASKAP observation 511 d post-burst. We confirmed this detection with further observations of the radio afterglow using the Australia Telescope Compact Array at 859 and 884 d post-burst. Combining this data with archival data from early-time radio observations, we showed the evolution of the radio spectral energy distribution alone could reveal clear signatures of a wind-like circumburst medium for the burst. Finally, we derived semi-analytical estimates for the microphysical shock parameters of the burst: electron power-law index p = 2.84, normalized wind-density parameter A* = 3, fractional energy in electrons $\epsilon$e = 0.3, and fractional energy in magnetic fields $\epsilon$B = 0.0002.},

Unlike the vast majority of the known pulsar population, PSR J1622-4950 appears to switch off for many hundreds of days and even in its on-state exhibits extreme variability in its flux density. Furthermore, the integrated pulse profile changes shape with epoch. All of these properties are remarkably similar to the only two magnetars previously known to emit radio pulsations.

We have observed this radio magnetar at 1.5 GHz with nearly daily cadence since the first detection of radio re-activation on 2018 December 8. In this paper, we report on the current timing properties of XTE J1810-197 and find that the magnitude of the spin frequency derivative has increased by a factor of 2.6 over our 48-d data set. We compare our results with the spin-down evolution reported during its previous active phase in the radio band. We also present total intensity pulse profiles at five different observing frequencies between 1.5 and 8.4 GHz, collected with the Lovell and the Effelsberg telescopes. The profile evolution in our data set is less erratic than what was reported during the previous active phase, and can be seen varying smoothly between observations. Profiles observed immediately after the outburst show the presence of at least five cycles of a very stable \~{}50 ms periodicity in the main pulse component that lasts for at least tens of days. This remarkable structure is seen across the full range of observing frequencies.},

We report a new LPT, DART J1832-0911 (2656.23 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.15 s period), the first evidence associating such objects to supernova remnants (SNRs). Its dispersion measure distance aligns well with the distance of the SNR, confirming its origin from a supernova explosion. The source displays either phase-locked circularly polarized emission or nearly 100\% linear polarization in radio bands. No detectable optical counterpart was found, even with a 10 m class telescope. The J1832-0911's SNR association, stable, highly polarized emission, and abnormally long period strongly favor its origin from a young neutron star, whose spin has been braked, possibly by interaction with supernova's fallback materials. This discovery provides critical insights into the nature of ultra-long period transients and their evolutionary link to stellar remnants.},

	abstract = {We discuss the impact of special relativistic effects on the observed light curves and variability duty cycles of radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We model the properties of AGN light curves at radio wavelengths using a shot-noise process in which the occurrence of major flaring events in a relativistic jet is governed by Poisson statistics. We show that flaring sources whose radiation is highly beamed toward us are able to reach very high flux levels, but will in fact spend most of their time in relatively low flaring states. This is primarily due to relativistic Doppler contraction of flaring timescales in the observer frame. The fact that highly beamed AGNs are not observed to return to a steady state quiescent level between flares implies that their weakly beamed counterparts should have highly stable flux densities that result from a superposition of many long-term, low-amplitude flares. The ``apparent'' quiescent flux levels of these weakly beamed AGNs (identified in most unified models as radio galaxies) will be significantly higher than their ``true'' quiescent (i.e., nonflaring) flux levels. We have also performed Monte Carlo simulations to examine how relativistic beaming and source variability bias the selection statistics of flat-spectrum AGN samples. We find that in the case of the Caltech-Jodrell Flat-Spectrum Survey, the predicted orientation bias toward jets seen end-on is weakened if the parent population is variable, because highly beamed sources have a stronger tendency to be found in low flaring states. This effect is small, however, because highly beamed sources are relatively rare, and in most cases their flux densities will be boosted sufficiently above the survey limit that they will be selected regardless of their flaring level. We find that, for larger flat-spectrum AGN surveys with fainter flux density cutoffs, variability should not be an appreciable source of selection bias.},

We carry out searches using time series of both total intensity and other polarization components in the form of Stokes parameters. We incorporate acceleration and its derivative in the pulsar search, and also search in segments of the entire observation to compensate for potential orbital motion of the pulsar. While no new pulsar is found, our observations yield the polarization profile of the GC magnetar PSR J1745-2900 at millimeter wavelength for the first time, which turns out to be nearly 100\% linearly polarized. Additionally, we estimate the survey sensitivity placed by both system and red noise, and evaluate its capability of finding pulsars in orbital motion with either Sgr A* or a binary companion. We show that the survey is sensitive to only the most luminous pulsars in the known population and future observations with ALMA in Band-1 will deliver significantly deeper survey sensitivity on the GC pulsar population.},

	abstract = {Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) play a key role in the fields of astrophysics and cosmology. It is widely accepted that SNe Ia arise from thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs (WDs) in binary systems. However, there is no consensus on the fundamental aspects of the nature of SN Ia progenitors and their actual explosion mechanism. This fundamentally flaws our understanding of these important astrophysical objects. In this review, we outline the diversity of SNe Ia and the proposed progenitor models and explosion mechanisms. We discuss the recent theoretical and observational progress in addressing the SN Ia progenitor and explosion mechanism in terms of the observables at various stages of the explosion, including rates and delay times, pre-explosion companion stars, ejecta-companion interaction, early excess emission, early radio/X-ray emission from circumstellar material interaction, surviving companion stars, late-time spectra and photometry, polarization signals and supernova remnant properties. Despite the efforts from both the theoretical and observational sides, questions of how the WDs reach an explosive state and what progenitor systems are more likely to produce SNe Ia remain open. No single published model is able to consistently explain all observational features and the full diversity of SNe Ia. This may indicate that either a new progenitor paradigm or an improvement in current models is needed if all SNe Ia arise from the same origin. An alternative scenario is that different progenitor channels and explosion mechanisms contribute to SNe Ia. In the next decade, the ongoing campaigns with the James Webb Space Telescope, Gaia and the Zwicky Transient Facility, and upcoming extensive projects with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time and the Square Kilometre Array will allow us to conduct not only studies of individual SNe Ia in unprecedented detail but also systematic investigations for different subclasses of SNe Ia. This will advance theory and observations of SNe Ia sufficiently far to gain a deeper understanding of their origin and explosion mechanism.},

Over half of these sources exhibited 2\%-10\% rms variations on timescales over 2 days. We analyzed the variations by two independent methods and find that the rms variability amplitudes of the sources correlate with the emission measure in the ionized interstellar medium along their respective lines of sight. We thus link the variations with interstellar scintillation of components of these sources, with some (unknown) fraction of the total flux density contained within a compact region of angular diameter in the range 10-50 $\mu$as. We also find that the variations decrease for high mean flux density sources and, most importantly, for high-redshift sources. The decrease in variability is probably due either to an increase in the apparent diameter of the source or to a decrease in the flux density of the compact fraction beyond z {\textasciitilde} 2.

	abstract = {Pulsars are often lauded for their (relative) rotational and radio emission stability over long time scales. However, long-term observing programmes are identifying an increasing number that deviate from this preconceived notion. Using Gaussian process regression and Bayesian inference techniques, we investigated the emission and rotational stability of 259 radio pulsars that have been monitored using Murriyang, the Parkes 64 m radio telescope, over the past three decades. We found 238 pulsars display significant variability in their spin-down rates, 52 of which also exhibit changes in profile shape. Including 23 known state-switching pulsars, this represents the largest catalogue of variable pulsars identified to date and indicates that these behaviours are ubiquitous among the wider population. The intensity of spin-down fluctuations positively scales with increasing pulsar spin-down rate, with only a marginal dependence on spin-frequency. This may have substantial implications for ongoing searches for gravitational waves in the ensemble timing of millisecond pulsars. We also discuss challenges in explaining the physical origins of quasi-periodic and transient profile/spin-down variations detected among a subset of our pulsars.},

The 1.6-22 $\mu$m spectral energy distribution in March 2010 was well fit by a highly obscured blackbody with T \~{} 1000 K and A\_\{K\_s\} \~{} 6.6 mag. The source is projected against the Infrared Dark Cloud (IRDC) SDC G331.062-0.294.

However, blackbody emission at T \~{} 1000 K is common in classical novae (especially CO novae) at the infrared peak in the light curve due to condensation of dust \~{}30-60 d after the explosion. Radio follow-up with the Australia Telescope Compact Array detected a fading continuum source with properties consistent with a classical nova but probably inconsistent with colliding protostars. Considering all VVV transients that could have been projected against a catalogued IRDC raises the probability of a chance association to p = 0.13-0.24.

The circular polarized fractions are limited to {\textgreater} 27\% at 3$\sigma$ confidence and two of the flares exhibit polarity reversal.

During the brightest observed flare, we also detect significant linear polarization with a polarization fraction {\textgreater} 18\%. Averaging the data in 6 minute, 10 MHz frequency bins we find that the flux density of these flares does not vary over the 30 MHz bandwidth of the Murchison Widefield Array; however, we cannot rule out finer time-frequency structure. Using the measured flux densities for the flares, we estimate brightness temperatures between (\{10\}13\{--\}\{10\}14) K, indicative of a coherent emission mechanism. The brightness temperature and polarization characteristics point to the electron cyclotron maser mechanism. We also calculate the flare rates given our four observed flares and compare them to flare rates for the set of M dwarf stars with known 100-200 MHz flares.

	abstract = {We suggest that fast-rising blue optical transients (FBOTs) and the brightest event of the class, AT2018cow, result from an electron-capture collapse to a neutron star following the merger of a massive ONeMg white dwarf (WD) with another WD. Two distinct evolutionary channels lead to the disruption of the less-massive WD during the merger and the formation of a shell-burning non-degenerate star incorporating the ONeMg core. During the shell-burning stage, a large fraction of the envelope is lost to the wind, while mass and angular momentum are added to the core. As a result, the electron-capture collapse occurs with a small envelope mass, after \~{}102-104 yr. During the formation of a neutron star, as little as \{\~{} \} 10{\textasciicircum}\{-2\} M\_{\textbackslash}odot of the material is ejected at the bounce-off with mildly relativistic velocities and total energy of about a few 1050 erg. This ejecta becomes optically thin on a time-scale of days - this is the FBOT. During the collapse, the neutron star is spun up and the magnetic field is amplified. The ensuing fast magnetically dominated relativistic wind from the newly formed neutron star shocks against the ejecta, and later against the wind. The radiation-dominated forward shock produces the long-lasting optical afterglow, while the termination shock of the relativistic wind produces the high-energy emission in a manner similar to pulsar wind nebulae. If the secondary WD was of the DA type, the wind will likely have \{\~{} \} 10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\} M\_{\textbackslash}odot of hydrogen; this explains the appearance of hydrogen late in the afterglow spectrum. The model explains many of the puzzling properties of FBOTs/AT2018cow: host galaxies, a fast and light anisotropic ejecta producing a bright optical peak, afterglow high-energy emission of similar luminosity to the optical, and late infrared features.},

	abstract = {Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are important distance indicators, element factories, cosmic-ray accelerators, kinetic-energy sources in galaxy evolution, and end points of stellar binary evolution. It has long been clear that a SN Ia must be the runaway thermonuclear explosion of a degenerate carbon-oxygen stellar core, most likely a white dwarf (WD). However, the specific progenitor systems of SNe Ia, and the processes that lead to their ignition, have not been identified. Two broad classes of progenitor binary systems have long been considered: single-degenerate (SD), in which a WD gains mass from a nondegenerate star; and double-degenerate (DD), involving the merger of two WDs. New theoretical work has enriched these possibilities with some interesting updates and variants. We review the significant recent observational progress in addressing the progenitor problem. We consider clues that have emerged from the observed properties of the various proposed progenitor populations, from studies of SN Ia sites{\textemdash}pre- and postexplosion{\textemdash}from analysis of the explosions themselves and from the measurement of event rates. The recent nearby and well-studied event, SN 2011fe, has been particularly revealing. The observational results are not yet conclusive and sometimes prone to competing theoretical interpretations. Nevertheless, it appears that DD progenitors, long considered the underdog option, could be behind some, if not all, SNe Ia. We point to some directions that may lead to future progress.},

	abstract = {The millisecond-duration radio flashes known as fast radio bursts (FRBs) represent an enigmatic astrophysical phenomenon. Recently, the sub-arcsecond localization (\~{}100 mas precision) of FRB 121102 using the Very Large Array has led to its unambiguous association with persistent radio and optical counterparts, and to the identification of its host galaxy. However, an even more precise localization is needed in order to probe the direct physical relationship between the millisecond bursts themselves and the associated persistent emission. Here, we report very-long-baseline radio interferometric observations using the European VLBI Network and the 305 m Arecibo telescope, which simultaneously detect both the bursts and the persistent radio emission at milliarcsecond angular scales and show that they are co-located to within a projected linear separation of ?40 pc (?12 mas angular separation, at 95\% confidence). We detect consistent angular broadening of the bursts and persistent radio source (\~{}2-4 mas at 1.7 GHz), which are both similar to the expected Milky Way scattering contribution. The persistent radio source has a projected size constrained to be ? 0.7 pc (?0.2 mas angular extent at 5.0 GHz) and a lower limit for the brightness temperature of \{T\}b? 5{\texttimes} \{10\}7 \{\{K\}\}. Together, these observations provide strong evidence for a direct physical link between FRB 121102 and the compact persistent radio source. We argue that a burst source associated with a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus or a young neutron star energizing a supernova remnant are the two scenarios for FRB 121102 that best match the observed data.},

Law et al. showed that FIRST J1419+3940 is a transient source decaying in brightness over the last few decades. One possible interpretation is that FIRST J1419+3940 is a nearby analog to FRB 121102 and that the radio emission represents a young magnetar nebula (as several scenarios assume for FRB 121102). Another interpretation is that FIRST J1419+3940 is the afterglow of an {\textquotedblleft}orphan{\textquotedblright} long gamma-ray burst (GRB). The environment is similar to where most such events are produced. To distinguish between these hypotheses, we conducted very long baseline interferometric (VLBI) radio observations using the European VLBI Network (EVN) at 1.6 GHz to spatially resolve the emission and to search for millisecond-duration radio bursts. We detect FIRST J1419+3940 as a compact radio source with a flux density of 620 {\textpm} 20 $\mu$Jy (on 2018 September 18) and a source size of 3.9 {\textpm} 0.7 mas (i.e., 1.6 {\textpm} 0.3 pc given the angular diameter distance of 83 Mpc). These results confirm that the radio emission is nonthermal and imply an average expansion velocity of (0.10 {\textpm} 0.02)c. Contemporaneous high-time-resolution observations using the 100 m Effelsberg telescope detected no millisecond-duration bursts of astrophysical origin. The source properties and lack of short-duration bursts are consistent with a GRB jet expansion, whereas they disfavor a magnetar birth nebula.},

It was proposed that FRB 121102 is powered by a young flaring magnetar, embedded within a decades-old supernova remnant. Using a time-dependent one-zone model, we show that a single expanding magnetized electron-ion nebula (created by the same outbursts likely responsible for the fast radio bursts) can explain all of the basic properties of the persistent source (size, flux, self-absorption constraints) and the large but decreasing rotation measure (RM) of the bursts. The persistent emission is powered by relativistic thermal electrons heated at the termination shock of the magnetar wind, while the RM originates from non-relativistic electrons injected earlier in the nebula{\textquoteright}s evolution and cooled through expansion and radiative losses. The model contains few free parameters, which are tightly constrained by observations: the total energy injected into the nebula over its history, \~{}1050-1051 erg, agrees with the magnetic energy of a millisecond magnetar; the baryon loading of the magnetar outflow (driven by intermittent flares) is close to the neutron star escape speed; the predicted source age \~{}10-40 yr is consistent with other constraints on the nebula size. For an energy input rate {\textbackslash}dot\{E\}{\textbackslash}propto \{t\}-$\alpha$ following the onset of magnetar activity, we predict secular decay of the RM and persistent source flux, which approximately follow RM ? t -(6+$\alpha$)/2 and \{F\}$\nu$ {\textbackslash}propto \{t\}-(\{$\alpha$ 2+7$\alpha$ -2)/4\}, respectively.},

	abstract = {Synchrotron emission is ubiquitous in explosive astrophysical events{\textemdash}it is a natural byproduct of shocks formed when matter expelled by the explosion collides with ambient material. This emission is well observed in various classes of transients, and is often interpreted within a canonical "equipartition" framework that allows physical properties of the shock to be inferred from the frequency and luminosity at which the observed spectral energy distribution (SED) peaks. This framework has been remarkably successful in explaining observations of radio supernovae. It has also been used for transrelativistic explosions, where the shock velocities approach the speed of light. However, the conventional framework does not incorporate relativistic effects. Neither does it account for thermal electrons, which have been shown to be important for high-velocity shocks. In this paper we describe a revised framework that accounts for these two effects, and is applicable to nonrelativistic, transrelativistic, and ultrarelativistic explosions. We show that accounting for these effects can dramatically change the inferred parameters of high-velocity shocks, and, in particular, that the shock velocity, ambient density, and total energy are overestimated by the conventional nonrelativistic framework. We delineate the phase-space where such modifications are important in terms of observationally measurable parameters. We also find a novel upper limit on the peak synchrotron luminosity of shock-powered transients, which is remarkably consistent with existing observations. Finally, we discuss a prediction of the model{\textemdash}that the SED will qualitatively change as a function of shock velocity{\textemdash}and show that this is broadly consistent with data for representative events (e.g., SN1998bw, AT2018cow, CSS161010, AT2020xnd).},

AT 2018cow rose over a few days to a peak luminosity L pk \~{} 4 {\texttimes} 1044 erg s-1, exceeding that of superluminous supernovae (SNe), before declining as L ? t -2. Initial spectra at $\delta$t ? 15 days were mostly featureless and indicated large expansion velocities v \~{} 0.1c and temperatures reaching T \~{} 3 {\texttimes} 104 K. Later spectra revealed a persistent optically thick photosphere and the emergence of H and He emission features with v \~{} 4000 km s-1 with no evidence for ejecta cooling. Our broadband monitoring revealed a hard X-ray spectral component at E >= 10 keV, in addition to luminous and highly variable soft X-rays, with properties unprecedented among astronomical transients. An abrupt change in the X-ray decay rate and variability appears to accompany the change in optical spectral properties. AT 2018cow showed bright radio emission consistent with the interaction of a blast wave with v sh \~{} 0.1c with a dense environment ({\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\~{} \{10\}-3-\{10\}-4 \{M\}? \{yr\vphantom{\{}\}\}-1 for v w = 1000 km s-1).

The engine released \~{}1050-1051.5 erg over \~{}103-105 s and resides within low-mass fast-moving material with equatorial-polar density asymmetry (M ej,fast ? 0.3 M ?). Successful SNe from low-mass H-rich stars (like electron-capture SNe) or failed explosions from blue supergiants satisfy these constraints. Intermediate-mass black holes are disfavored by the large environmental density probed by the radio observations.},

	abstract = {We present a generalized analytic formalism for the inverse Compton X-ray emission from hydrogen-poor supernovae and apply this framework to SN 2011fe using Swift X-Ray Telescope (XRT), UVOT, and Chandra observations. We characterize the optical properties of SN 2011fe in the Swift bands and find them to be broadly consistent with a "normal" SN Ia, however, no X-ray source is detected by either XRT or Chandra. We constrain the progenitor system mass-loss rate {\textbackslash}dot\{M\}{\textless} 2{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-9\}{\textbackslash} \{M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\}{\textbackslash} yr{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} (3$\sigma$ c.l.) for wind velocity vw = 100 km s-1. Our result rules out symbiotic binary progenitors for SN 2011fe and argues against Roche lobe overflowing subgiants and main-sequence secondary stars if {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 1\% of the transferred mass is lost at the Lagrangian points. Regardless of the density profile, the X-ray non-detections are suggestive of a clean environment (n CSM {\textless} 150 cm-3) for 2 {\texttimes} 1015 {\textless}{\textasciitilde} R {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 5 {\texttimes} 1016 cm around the progenitor site. This is either consistent with the bulk of material being confined within the binary system or with a significant delay between mass loss and supernova explosion. We furthermore combine X-ray and radio limits from Chomiuk et al. to constrain the post-shock energy density in magnetic fields. Finally, we searched for the shock breakout pulse using gamma-ray observations from the Interplanetary Network and find no compelling evidence for a supernova-associated burst. Based on the compact radius of the progenitor star we estimate that the shock breakout pulse was likely not detectable by current satellites.},

Our broad-band analysis constrains the explosion properties of GRB 100316D to be intermediate between highly relativistic, collimated GRBs and the spherical, ordinary hydrogen-stripped SNe. We find that {\textasciitilde}1049 erg is coupled to mildly relativistic ($\Gamma$ = 1.5-2), quasi-spherical ejecta, expanding into a medium previously shaped by the progenitor mass-loss with a rate of {\textbackslash}dot\{M\}{\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}sim \}{\textbackslash}, 10{\textasciicircum}\{-5\}{\textbackslash},M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}{\textbackslash},yr{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} (for an assumed wind density profile and wind velocity vw = 1000 km s-1). The kinetic energy profile of the ejecta argues for the presence of a central engine and identifies GRB 100316D as one of the weakest central-engine-driven explosions detected to date. Emission from the central engine is responsible for an excess of soft X-ray radiation that dominates over the standard afterglow at late times (t {\textgreater} 10 days). We connect this phenomenology with the birth of the most rapidly rotating magnetars. Alternatively, accretion onto a newly formed black hole might explain the excess of radiation. However, significant departure from the standard fall-back scenario is required.},

The 2-10 keV variability on timescales of {\textasciitilde}1 day, as probed by ASCA, is included. All sources exhibit stronger X-ray variability toward longer timescales, but the increase is greater for relatively higher luminosity sources. Variability amplitudes are anticorrelated with X-ray luminosity and black hole mass, but amplitudes saturate and become independent of luminosity or black hole mass toward the longest timescales. The data are consistent with the models of power spectral density (PSD) movement described by Markowitz and coworkers and McHardy and coworkers, whereby Seyfert 1 galaxies' variability can be described by a single, universal PSD shape whose break frequency scales with black hole mass. The best-fitting scaling relations between variability timescale, black hole mass, and X-ray luminosity imply an average accretion rate of {\textasciitilde}5\% of the Eddington limit for the sample. Nearly all sources exhibit stronger variability in the relatively soft 2-4 keV band compared to the 7-12 keV band on all timescales. There are indications that relatively less luminous or less massive sources exhibit a greater degree of spectral variability for a given increase in overall flux.},

	abstract = {White dwarfs are compact stars, similar in size to Earth but approximately 200,000 times more massive. Isolated white dwarfs emit most of their power from ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths, but when in close orbits with less dense stars, white dwarfs can strip material from their companions and the resulting mass transfer can generate atomic line and X-ray emission, as well as near- and mid-infrared radiation if the white dwarf is magnetic. However, even in binaries, white dwarfs are rarely detected at far-infrared or radio frequencies. Here we report the discovery of a white dwarf/cool star binary that emits from X-ray to radio wavelengths. The star, AR Scorpii (henceforth AR Sco), was classified in the early 1970s as a $\delta$-Scuti star, a common variety of periodic variable star. Our observations reveal instead a 3.56-hour period close binary, pulsing in brightness on a period of 1.97 minutes. The pulses are so intense that AR Sco{\textquoteright}s optical flux can increase by a factor of four within 30 seconds, and they are also detectable at radio frequencies. They reflect the spin of a magnetic white dwarf, which we find to be slowing down on a 107-year timescale. The spin-down power is an order of magnitude larger than that seen in electromagnetic radiation, which, together with an absence of obvious signs of accretion, suggests that AR Sco is primarily spin-powered. Although the pulsations are driven by the white dwarf{\textquoteright}s spin, they mainly originate from the cool star. AR Sco{\textquoteright}s broadband spectrum is characteristic of synchrotron radiation, requiring relativistic electrons. These must either originate from near the white dwarf or be generated in situ at the M star through direct interaction with the white dwarf{\textquoteright}s magnetosphere.},

They suggest the presence of additional activities of the SN progenitor driving the enhancement of the mass-loss rate, and some physical processes attributing to a single star's activities have been considered. In this study, we carry out binary evolutionary simulations of massive stars by MESA and investigate effects on the subsequent CSM formation through hydrodynamical simulations by PLUTO. We show that the mass transfer rate in a binary can increase at the beginning of the Roche lobe overflow, and this enhancement would be associated with the structure of the CSM before the explosion. We also illustrate that, depending on the orbital period of the binary, the density structure of the CSM can have a diverse distribution, including shell-like and cliff-like structures. These characteristic structures appear within the length scale of \~{}1017 cm and could be traced by long-term observations of SNe, if the slow velocity of the CSM is assumed (\~{}10 km s-1). Our results highlight the importance of binary interaction in the aspect of reproducing the diversity of the CSM configuration.},

A shell of circumstellar medium (CSM) detached from the SN progenitor has been considered to play a viable role in characterizing such a rebrightening of radio emission. Here, we propose another mechanism that can give rise to the double-peaked radio light curve in core-collapse SNe. The key ingredient in the present work is to expand the model for the evolution of the synchrotron spectral energy distribution (SED) to a generic form, including fast and slow cooling regimes, as guided by the widely accepted modeling scheme of gamma-ray burst afterglows. We show that even without introducing an additional CSM shell, the radio light curve would show a double-peaked morphology when the system becomes optically thin to synchrotron self-absorption at the observational frequency during the fast cooling regime. We can observe this double-peaked feature if the transition from the fast cooling to slow cooling regime occurs during the typical observational timescale of SNe. This situation is realized when the minimum Lorentz factor of injected electrons is initially large enough for the nonthermal electrons' SED to be discrete from the thermal distribution. We propose SN 2007bg as a special case of double-peaked radio SNe that can be possibly explained by the presented scenario. Our model can serve as a potential diagnostic for electron acceleration properties in SNe.},

This program started in mid-2007 and is currently monitoring about 1800 blazars, including most of the bright blazars north of declination -20 degrees. These results include: characterization of the variability in the radio band; its relationship with optical and gamma-ray properties; and its relationship to gamma-ray emission as observed with Fermi-LAT, which can provide constrains on the location of the gamma-ray emission region. We will also discuss our ongoing work on the characterization of radio variability using the power spectral density. For this, we are using 8 years of OVRO 40m data for {\textasciitilde}1200 sources, and also F-GAMMA monitoring data taken with the Effelsberg 100m telescope for 60 sources with about monthly cadence monitoring data at 8 frequencies between 2.6 and 43.0 GHz. These studies will provide an improved understanding of blazar variability, a better basis to evaluate the statistics of correlated variability between different emission bands, and a long and consistent record of radio observations to be used in gamma-ray and multi-wavelength investigations.},

	abstract = {A large sample of known and likely gamma-ray blazars has been monitored twice per week since late 2007 at 15 GHz with the Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO) 40-meter Telescope. The sample contains about 1700 sources, including the initial sample of 1158 sources above declination -20 degrees from the Candidate Gamma-Ray Blazar Survey (CGRaBS) plus all the blazars associated with Fermi-LAT detections as released in the Fermi AGN catalogs. Using statistical likelihood analyses, we compare the variability amplitude for various sub-populations within our sample. These include comparisons of gamma-ray-loud versus quiet objects, BL Lac objects versus flat-spectrum radio quasars, and a study of the variability amplitude trend with redshift. To learn about the location of the gamma-ray emission region we study the significance of peaks in the radio/gamma-ray cross-correlation using Monte Carlo simulations. First results for 52 sources with data from both the high-confidence Fermi Large Area Telescope Bright AGN Sample and the first 2 years of our monitoring program are presented. We find that assuming a power spectral density with power law slope of -2 at 15 GHz and -1.5 at gamma-ray energies, 7 of our objects show cross-correlations at the 3sigma level. We are now studying the physical significance of these correlations by further exploring the range of power law slopes that are consistent with the data. An extension of this to a larger sample and longer light curves is underway and preliminary results are presented. We also describe KuPol, the new digital Ku-band receiver being constructed for the 40-meter telescope. This new receiver will provide total intensity and linear polarization measurements over the 12-18 GHz band, with 16 MHz spectral resolution. The polarization data will provide important clues about the magnetic field configuration in the radio emission region.},

	abstract = {Fast radio bursts (FRBs) last for milliseconds and arrive at Earth from cosmological distances. While their origin(s) and emission mechanism(s) are presently unknown, their signals bear similarities with the much less luminous radio emission generated by pulsars within our Galaxy and several lines of evidence point toward neutron star origins. For pulsars, the linear polarisation position angle (PA) often exhibits evolution over the pulse phase that is interpreted within a geometric framework known as the rotating vector model (RVM). Here, we report on a fast radio burst, FRB 20221022A, detected by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) and localized to a nearby host galaxy (\${\textbackslash}sim 65{\textbackslash}; {\textbackslash}rm\{Mpc\}\$), MCG+14-02-011. This one-off FRB displays a \${\textbackslash}sim 130\$ degree rotation of its PA over its \${\textbackslash}sim 2.5{\textbackslash}; {\textbackslash}rm\{ms\}\$ burst duration, closely resembling the "S"-shaped PA evolution commonly seen from pulsars and some radio magnetars. The PA evolution disfavours emission models involving shocks far from the source and instead suggests magnetospheric origins for this source which places the emission region close to the FRB central engine, echoing similar conclusions drawn from tempo-polarimetric studies of some repeating sources. This FRB's PA evolution is remarkably well-described by the RVM and, although we cannot determine the inclination and magnetic obliquity due to the unknown period/duty cycle of the source, we can dismiss extremely short-period pulsars (e.g., recycled millisecond pulsars) as potential progenitors. RVM-fitting appears to favour a source occupying a unique position in the period/duty cycle phase space that implies tight opening angles for the beamed emission, significantly reducing burst energy requirements of the source.},

This was demonstrated recently by the discovery of a previously unknown type of source, varying on timescales of minutes to hours. Here we report a search for radio sources that vary on much shorter timescales. We found eleven objects characterized by single, dispersed bursts having durations between 2 and 30ms. The average time intervals between bursts range from 4min to 3h with radio emission typically detectable for {\textless}1s per day. From an analysis of the burst arrival times, we have identified periodicities in the range 0.4-7s for ten of the eleven sources, suggesting origins in rotating neutron stars. Despite the small number of sources detected at present, their ephemeral nature implies a total Galactic population significantly exceeding that of the regularly pulsing radio pulsars. Five of the ten sources have periods {\textgreater}4s, and the rate of change of the pulse period has been measured for three of them; for one source, we have inferred a high magnetic field strength of 5 {\texttimes} 1013G. This suggests that the new population is related to other classes of isolated neutron stars observed at X-ray and $\gamma$-ray wavelengths.},

	abstract = {Three known examples of coherent emission in radio astronomical sources are reviewed: plasma emission, electron cyclotron maser emission (ECME) and pulsar radio emission. Plasma emission is a multi-stage mechanism with the first stage being generation of Langmuir waves through a streaming instability, and subsequent stages involving partial conversion of the Langmuir turbulence into escaping radiation at the fundamental (F) and second harmonic (H) of the plasma frequency. The early development and subsequent refinements of the theory, motivated by application to solar radio bursts, are reviewed. The driver of the instability is faster electrons outpacing slower electrons, resulting in a positive gradient (\{d\}f(v\_allel )/\{d\}v\_allel {\textgreater}0) at the front of the beam. Despite many successes of the theory, there is no widely accepted explanation for type I bursts and various radio continua. The earliest models for ECME were purely theoretical, and the theory was later adapted and applied to Jupiter (DAM), the Earth (AKR), solar spike bursts and flare stars. ECME strongly favors the x mode, whereas plasma emission favors the o mode. Two drivers for ECME are a ring feature (implying \{d\}f(v)/\{d\}v{\textgreater}0) and a loss-cone feature. Loss-cone-driven ECME was initially favored for all applications. The now favored driver for AKR is the ring-feature in a horseshoe distribution, which results from acceleration by a parallel electric on converging magnetic field lines. The driver in DAM and solar and stellar applications is uncertain. The pulsar radio emission mechanism remains an enigma. Ingredients needed in discussing possible mechanisms are reviewed: general properties of pulsars, pulsar electrodynamics, the properties of pulsar plasma and wave dispersion in such plasma. Four specific emission mechanisms (curvature emission, linear acceleration emission, relativistic plasma emission and anomalous Doppler emission) are discussed and it is argued that all encounter difficulties. Coherent radio emission from extensive air showers in the Earth's atmosphere is reviewed briefly. The difference in theoretical approach from astrophysical theories is pointed out and discussed. Fine structures in DAM and in pulsar radio emission are discussed, and it is suggested that trapping in a large-amplitude wave, as in a model for discrete VLF emission, provides a plausible explanation. A possible direct measure of coherence is pointed out.},

Using the MeerKAT radio telescope, we conducted follow-up observations of the long-period radio transient GPM J1839-10. Here we report that the source exhibits a wide range of unusual emission properties, including polarization characteristics indicative of magnetospheric origin, linear-to-circular polarization conversion, and drifting substructures closely resembling those observed in repeating FRBs. These radio characteristics provide evidence in support of the long-period magnetar model and suggest a possible connection between long-period radio transients, magnetars, and FRBs.

	abstract = {Strongly magnetized, rapidly rotating neutron stars are contenders for the central engines of both long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) and hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I). Models for typical (minute long) LGRBs invoke magnetars with high dipole magnetic fields (Bd ? 1015 G) and short spin-down times, SLSNe-I require neutron stars with weaker fields and longer spin-down times of weeks. Here, we identify a transition region in the space of Bd and birth period for which a magnetar can power both a LGRB and a luminous supernova. In particular, a 2 ms period magnetar with a spin-down time of \~{}104 s can explain both the ultralong GRB 111209 and its associated luminous SN2011kl. For magnetars with longer spin-down times, we predict even longer duration (\~{}105 - 6 s) GRBs and brighter supernovae, a correlation that extends to Swift J2058+05 (commonly interpreted as a tidal disruption event). We further show that previous estimates of the maximum rotational energy of a protomagnetar were too conservative and energies up to Emax \~{} 1-2 {\texttimes} 1053 ergs are possible. A magnetar can therefore comfortably accommodate the extreme energy requirements recently posed by the most luminous supernova ASASSN-15lh. The luminous pulsar wind nebula powering ASASSN-15lh may lead to an `ionization breakout' X-ray burst over the coming months, accompanied by a change in the optical spectrum.},

	abstract = {The impending era of wide-field radio surveys has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of astrophysical transients. Here we evaluate the prospects of a wide range of planned and hypothetical radio surveys using the properties and volumetric rates of known and hypothetical classes of extragalactic synchrotron radio transients (e.g., on-axis and off-axis gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), supernovae, tidal disruption events, compact object mergers). Utilizing these sources and physically motivated considerations we assess the allowed phase space of radio luminosity and peak timescale for extragalactic transients. We also include for the first time effects such as redshift evolution of the rates, K-corrections, and non-Euclidean luminosity distance, which affect the detection rates of the most sensitive surveys. The number of detected events is calculated by means of a Monte Carlo method, using the various survey properties (depth, cadence, area) and realistic detection criteria that include a cut on the minimum variability of the transients during the survey and an assessment of host galaxy contamination. We find that near-term GHz frequency surveys (ASKAP/VAST, Very Large Array Sky Survey) will detect few events: ? 30-50 on- and off-axis long GRBs (LGRBs) and off-axis tidal disruption events, and \~{} 50-100 neutron star binary mergers if \~{} 0.5\% of the mergers result in a stable millisecond magnetar. Low-frequency surveys (e.g., LOFAR) are unlikely to detect any transients, while a hypothetical large-scale mm survey may detect \~{}40 on-axis LGRBs. On the other hand, we find that SKA1 surveys at \~{} 0.1-1 GHz have the potential to uncover thousands of transients, mainly on-axis and off-axis LGRBs, on-axis short GRBs, off-axis TDEs, and neutron star binary mergers with magnetar remnants.},

We show that all of these properties are consistent with the tidal disruption and hyper-accretion of a Wolf-Rayet (WR) star by a black hole or neutron star binary companion. In contrast with related previous models, the merger occurs with a long delay (?100 yr) following the common envelope (CE) event responsible for birthing the binary, as a result of gradual angular momentum loss to a relic circumbinary disk. Disk-wind outflows from the merger-generated accretion flow generate the 56Ni-poor aspherical ejecta with the requisite velocity range. The optical light curve is powered primarily by reprocessing X-rays from the inner accretion flow/jet, though CSM shock interaction also contributes. Primary CSM sources include WR mass loss from the earliest stages of the merger (?1014 cm) and the relic CE disk and its photoevaporation-driven wind (?1016 cm). Longer delayed mergers may instead give rise to supernovae Type Ibn/Icn (depending on the WR evolutionary state), connecting these transient classes with LFBOTs.},

Radio observations prior to 2023 show a faint and compact radio source typical of a radio-quiet AGN. Starting in 2023 February, 1ES 1927+654 began exhibiting a radio flare with a steep exponential rise, reaching a peak 60 times previous flux levels, and has maintained this higher level of radio emission for over a year to date. The 5{\textendash}23 GHz spectrum is broadly similar to gigahertz-peaked radio sources, which are understood to be young radio jets less than \~{}1000 yr old. Recent high-resolution Very Long Baseline Array observations at 23.5 GHz now show resolved extensions on either side of the core, with a separation of \~{}0.15 pc, consistent with a new and mildly relativistic bipolar outflow. A steady increase in the soft X-ray band (0.3{\textendash}2 keV) concurrent with the radio may be consistent with jet-driven shocked gas, though further observations are needed to test alternate scenarios.

The only known repeating fast radio burst source{\textemdash}FRB 121102{\textemdash}has been localized to a star-forming region in a dwarf galaxy at redshift 0.193 and is spatially coincident with a compact, persistent radio source. The origin of the bursts, the nature of the persistent source and the properties of the local environment are still unclear. Here we report observations of FRB 121102 that show almost 100 per cent linearly polarized emission at a very high and variable Faraday rotation measure in the source frame (varying from +1.46 {\texttimes} 105 radians per square metre to +1.33 {\texttimes} 105 radians per square metre at epochs separated by seven months) and narrow (below 30 microseconds) temporal structure. The large and variable rotation measure demonstrates that FRB 121102 is in an extreme and dynamic magneto-ionic environment, and the short durations of the bursts suggest a neutron star origin. Such large rotation measures have hitherto been observed only in the vicinities of massive black holes (larger than about 10,000 solar masses). Indeed, the properties of the persistent radio source are compatible with those of a low-luminosity, accreting massive black hole. The bursts may therefore come from a neutron star in such an environment or could be explained by other models, such as a highly magnetized wind nebula or supernova remnant surrounding a young neutron star.},

X-ray emission is significantly detected at a location consistent with AT 2018cow. The very soft X-ray spectrum and sustained luminosity are distinct from the spectral and temporal behavior of the LFBOT in the first \~{}100 days and would possibly signal the emergence of a new emission component, although a robust association with AT 2018cow can only be claimed at $\delta$ t \~{} 220 days, while at $\delta$ t \~{} 1350 days contamination of the host galaxy cannot be excluded. We interpret these findings in the context of the late-time panchromatic emission from AT 2018cow, which includes the detection of persistent, slowly fading UV emission with $\nu$ L $\nu$ ? 1039 erg s-1. Similar to previous works (and in analogy with arguments for ultraluminous X-ray sources), these late-time observations are consistent with thin disks around intermediate-mass black holes (with M {\textbullet} ? 103{\textendash}104 M ?) accreting at sub-Eddington rates. However, differently from previous studies, we find that smaller-mass black holes with M {\textbullet} ? 10{\textendash}100 M ? accreting at ?the Eddington rate cannot be ruled out and provide a natural explanation for the inferred compact size (R out ? 40 R ?) of the accretion disk years after the optical flare. Most importantly, irrespective of the accretor mass, our study lends support to the hypothesis that LFBOTs are accretion-powered phenomena and that, specifically, LFBOTs constitute electromagnetic manifestations of super-Eddington accreting systems that evolve to ?Eddington over a ?100-day timescale. *Based on observations obtained with XMM-Newton, an ESA science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by ESA Member States and NASA.},

	abstract = {Pulsar timing arrays search for nanohertz-frequency gravitational waves by regularly observing ensembles of millisecond pulsars over many years to look for correlated timing residuals. Recently the first evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background has been presented by the major arrays, with varying levels of significance (\$\{{\textbackslash}sim\} 2{\textbackslash}sigma {\textbackslash}!-{\textbackslash}! 4{\textbackslash}sigma\$). In this paper, we present the results of background searches with the MeerKAT Pulsar Timing Array. Although of limited duration (4.5 yr), the \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\} 250{\textbackslash},000\$ arrival times with a median error of just \$3 {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mu \{{\textbackslash}rm s\}\$ on 83 pulsars make it very sensitive to spatial correlations. Detection of a gravitational wave background requires careful modelling of noise processes to ensure that any correlations represent a fit to the underlying background and not other misspecified processes. Under different assumptions about noise processes, we can produce either what appear to be compelling Hellings-Downs correlations of high significance (\$3{\textbackslash}sigma {\textbackslash}!-{\textbackslash}! 3.4{\textbackslash}sigma\$) with a spectrum close to that which is predicted, or surprisingly, under slightly different assumptions, ones that are insignificant. This appears to be related to the fact that many of the highest precision MeerKAT Pulsar Timing Array pulsars are in close proximity and dominate the detection statistics. The sky-averaged characteristic strain amplitude of the correlated signal in our most significant model is \$h\_\{\{{\textbackslash}rm c\}, \{{\textbackslash}rm yr\}\} = 7.5{\textasciicircum}\{+0.8\}\_\{-0.9\} {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-15\}\$ measured at a spectral index of \${\textbackslash}alpha =-0.26\$, decreasing to \$h\_\{\{{\textbackslash}rm c\}, \{{\textbackslash}rm yr\}\} = 4.8{\textasciicircum}\{+0.8\}\_\{-0.9\} {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-15\}\$ when assessed at the predicted \${\textbackslash}alpha =-2/3\$. These data will be valuable as the International Pulsar Timing Array project explores the significance of gravitational wave detections and their dependence on the assumed noise models.},

The lack of narrow H Balmer lines suggests that interaction with circumstellar material is not a dominant source of the observed late-time emission. We also present a deep Chandra observation that reveals no X-ray emission down to a luminosity of L X {\textless} 2 {\texttimes} 1038 erg s-1 (0.5-10 keV). Our findings are consistent with the notion that SN 2012au is associated with a diverse subset of SNe, including long-duration gamma-ray burst SNe and superluminous SNe, harboring pulsar/magnetar wind nebulae that influence core-collapse explosion dynamics on a wide range of energy scales. We hypothesize that these systems may all evolve into a similar late-time phase dominated by forbidden oxygen transitions, and predict that emission line widths should remain constant or broaden a few percent per year due to the acceleration of ejecta by the pulsar/magnetar bubble.},

	abstract = {Powerful relativistic jets are one of the main ways in which accreting black holes provide kinetic feedback to their surroundings. Jets launched from or redirected by the accretion flow that powers them are expected to be affected by the dynamics of the flow, which for accreting stellar-mass black holes has shown evidence for precession1 due to frame-dragging effects that occur when the black-hole spin axis is misaligned with the orbital plane of its companion star2. Recently, theoretical simulations have suggested that the jets can exert an additional torque on the accretion flow3, although the interplay between the dynamics of the accretion flow and the launching of the jets is not yet understood. Here we report a rapidly changing jet orientation{\textemdash}on a time scale of minutes to hours{\textemdash}in the black-hole X-ray binary V404 Cygni, detected with very-long-baseline interferometry during the peak of its 2015 outburst. We show that this changing jet orientation can be modelled as the Lense-Thirring precession of a vertically extended slim disk that arises from the super-Eddington accretion rate4. Our findings suggest that the dynamics of the precessing inner accretion disk could play a role in either directly launching or redirecting the jets within the inner few hundred gravitational radii. Similar dynamics should be expected in any strongly accreting black hole whose spin is misaligned with the inflowing gas, both affecting the observational characteristics of the jets and distributing the black-hole feedback more uniformly over the surrounding environment5,6.},

As a result, a measurement of its radius will provide unique insight into the properties of neutron star core matter at high densities. Here we report a radius measurement based on fits of rotating hot spot patterns to Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) and X-ray Multi-Mirror (XMM-Newton) X-ray observations. We find that the equatorial circumferential radius of PSR J0740+6620 is \$\{13.7\}\_\{-1.5\}{\textasciicircum}\{+2.6\}\$ km (68\%). We apply our measurement, combined with the previous NICER mass and radius measurement of PSR J0030+0451, the masses of two other {\textasciitilde}2 M? pulsars, and the tidal deformability constraints from two gravitational wave events, to three different frameworks for equation-of-state modeling, and find consistent results at {\textasciitilde}1.5-5 times nuclear saturation density. For a given framework, when all measurements are included, the radius of a 1.4 M? neutron star is known to {\textpm}4\% (68\% credibility) and the radius of a 2.08 M? neutron star is known to {\textpm}5\%. The full radius range that spans the {\textpm}1$\sigma$ credible intervals of all the radius estimates in the three frameworks is 12.45 {\textpm} 0.65 km for a 1.4 M? neutron star and 12.35 {\textpm} 0.75 km for a 2.08 M? neutron star.},

	abstract = {We model the non-thermal transient Swift J1644+57 as resulting from a relativistic jet powered by the accretion of a tidally disrupted star on to a supermassive black hole. Accompanying synchrotron radio emission is produced by the shock interaction between the jet and the dense circumnuclear medium, similar to a gamma-ray burst afterglow. An open mystery, however, is the origin of the late-time radio re-brightening, which occurred well after the peak of the jetted X-ray emission. Here, we systematically explore several proposed explanations for this behaviour by means of multidimensional hydrodynamic simulations coupled to a self-consistent radiative transfer calculation of the synchrotron emission. Our main conclusion is that the radio afterglow of Swift J1644+57 is not naturally explained by a jet with a one-dimensional top-hat angular structure. However, a more complex angular structure comprised of an ultrarelativistic core (Lorentz factor $\Gamma$ \~{} 10) surrounded by a slower ($\Gamma$ \~{} 2) sheath provides a reasonable fit to the data. Such a geometry could result from the radial structure of the super-Eddington accretion flow or as the result of jet precession. The total kinetic energy of the ejecta that we infer of \~{} few 1053 erg requires a highly efficient jet launching mechanism. Our jet model providing the best fit to the light curve of the on-axis event Swift J1644+57 is used to predict the radio light curves for off-axis viewing angles. Implications for the presence of relativistic jets from tidal disruption events (TDEs) detected via their thermal disc emission, as well as the prospects for detecting orphan TDE afterglows with upcoming wide-field radio surveys and resolving the jet structure with long baseline interferometry, are discussed.},

With an astrometric precision up to 25 $\mu$as per epoch, the rapidly fading compact mas-scale source is found to be nonjetted with a proper motion of <=0.15 mas yr-1 (0.14 c). This and a dense (number density ?104-105 cm-3) magnetized environment (magnetic field strength >=0.84 G) are characteristic of a newly formed magnetar driven central engine, originating in the successful explosion of a low-mass star.},

GRB 100418a was a peculiar GRB with unusual X-ray and optical afterglow profiles featuring a plateau phase with a very shallow rise. This observed plateau phase was believed to be due to a continued energy injection mechanism that powered the forward shock, giving rise to an unusual and long-lasting afterglow. The radio afterglow of GRB 100418a was detectable several weeks after the prompt emission. We conducted long-term monitoring observations of the afterglow and attempted to test the energy injection model advocating that the continuous energy injection is due to shells of material moving at a wide range of Lorentz factors. We obtained an upper limit of $\gamma$ {\textless} 7 for the expansion rate of the GRB 100418a radio afterglow, indicating that the range-of-Lorentz factor model could only be applicable for relatively slow-moving ejecta. A preferred explanation could be that continued activity of the central engine may have powered the long-lasting afterglow.},

The radio data reveal a synchrotron self-absorption peak around 0.3 GHz and a radius of around 1.3 mas (0.5 pc) 26 yr post-discovery, indicating a blastwave energy {\textasciitilde}5 {\texttimes} 1050 erg. The optical spectrum shows a broad [O III]$\lambda$4959,5007 emission line that may indicate collisional excitation in the host galaxy, but its association with the transient cannot be ruled out. The properties of the host galaxy are suggestive of a massive stellar progenitor that formed at low metallicity. Based on the radio light curve, blastwave velocity, energetics, nature of the host galaxy and transient rates, we find that the properties of J1419+3940 are most consistent with long gamma-ray burst (LGRB) afterglows. Other classes of (optically discovered) stellar explosions as well as neutron star mergers are disfavored, and invoking any exotic scenario may not be necessary. It is therefore likely that J1419+3940 is an off-axis LGRB afterglow (as suggested by Law et al. and Marcote et al.), and under this premise the inverse beaming fraction is found to be \$\{f\}\_\{b\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textbackslash}simeq \{280\}\_\{-200\}{\textasciicircum}\{+700\}\$ , corresponding to an average jet half-opening angle \$ \{{\textbackslash}theta \}\_\{j\} {\textbackslash}simeq \{5\}\_\{-2\}{\textasciicircum}\{+4\}\$ degrees (68\% confidence), consistent with previous estimates. From the volumetric rate we predict that surveys with the Very Large Array, Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder, and MeerKAT will find a handful of J1419+3940-like events over the coming years.},

	abstract = {GW170817 was the first gravitational-wave detection of a binary neutron-star merger. It was accompanied by radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum and localized to the galaxy NGC 4993 at a distance of 40 megaparsecs. It has been proposed that the observed $\gamma$-ray, X-ray and radio emission is due to an ultra-relativistic jet being launched during the merger (and successfully breaking out of the surrounding material), directed away from our line of sight (off-axis). The presence of such a jet is predicted from models that posit neutron-star mergers as the drivers of short hard-$\gamma$-ray bursts. Here we report that the radio light curve of GW170817 has no direct signature of the afterglow of an off-axis jet. Although we cannot completely rule out the existence of a jet directed away from the line of sight, the observed $\gamma$-ray emission could not have originated from such a jet. Instead, the radio data require the existence of a mildly relativistic wide-angle outflow moving towards us. This outflow could be the high-velocity tail of the neutron-rich material that was ejected dynamically during the merger, or a cocoon of material that breaks out when a jet launched during the merger transfers its energy to the dynamical ejecta. Because the cocoon model explains the radio light curve of GW170817, as well as the $\gamma$-ray and X-ray emission (and possibly also the ultraviolet and optical emission), it is the model that is most consistent with the observational data. Cocoons may be a ubiquitous phenomenon produced in neutron-star mergers, giving rise to a hitherto unidentified population of radio, ultraviolet, X-ray and $\gamma$-ray transients in the local Universe.},

Jansky Very Large Array, the Australia Telescope Compact Array, the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope and the MeerKAT telescope. We use these data to precisely characterize the decay phase of the late-time radio light curve. We find that the temporal decay is consistent with a power-law slope of t -2.2, and that the transition between the power-law rise and decay is relatively sharp. Such a slope cannot be produced by a quasi-isotropic (cocoon-dominated) outflow, but is instead the classic signature of a relativistic jet. This provides strong observational evidence that GW170817 produced a successful jet, and directly demonstrates the link between binary neutron star mergers and short-hard gamma-ray bursts. Using simple analytical arguments, we derive constraints on the geometry and the jet opening angle of GW170817. These results are consistent with those from our companion very long baseline interferometry paper, reporting superluminal motion in GW170817.},

We show that for our observations, a sampling rate of just 2 Hz is sufficient to resolve the IPS signature of most sources. We develop tests to ensure that IPS variability is separated from ionospheric or instrumental variability. We validate our results by comparison with existing catalogues of IPS sources, and near-contemporaneous observations by other IPS facilities. Using just 5 min of data, we produce catalogues at both 79 and 158 MHz, each containing over 350 scintillating sources. At the field centre, we detect approximately one scintillating source per square degree, with a minimum scintillating flux density at 158 MHz of 110 mJy, corresponding to a compact flux density of approximately 400 mJy. Each of these sources is a known radio source, however only a minority were previously known to contain sub-arcsecond components.

This review discusses the observed structure and activity of the interstellar medium in this region in terms of its inevitable inflow toward the center of the Galactic gravitational potential well. A number of dissipative processes lead to a strong concentration of gas into a "Central Molecular Zone" of about 200-pc radius, in which the molecular medium is characterized by large densities, large velocity dispersions, high temperatures, and apparently strong magnetic fields. The physical state of the gas and the resultant star formation processes occurring in this environment are therefore quite unlike those occurring in the large-scale disk. Gas not consumed by star formation either enters a hot X ray-emitting halo and is lost as a thermally driven galactic wind or continues moving inward, probably discontinuously, through the domain of the few parsec-sized circumnuclear disks and eventually into the central parsec. There, the central radio source SgrA* currently accepts only a tiny fraction of the inflowing material, likely as a result of a limit cycle wherein the continual inflow of matter provokes star formation, which in turn can temporarily halt the inflow via mass-outflow winds.},

	abstract = {We present new colour-effective temperature (Teff) transformations based on the photometry of the early third data release (EDR3) of the ESA/Gaia mission. These relations are calibrated on a sample of about 600 dwarf and giant stars for which Teff has previously been determined with the infrared flux method from dereddened colours. The 1$\sigma$ dispersion of the transformations is of 60-80 K for the pure Gaia colours (BP-RP)0, (BP-G)0, and (G-RP)0, improving to 40-60 K for colours including the 2MASS Ks-band, namely (BP-Ks)0, (RP-Ks)0, and (G-Ks)0. We validate these relations in the most challenging case of dense stellar fields, where the Gaia EDR3 photometry could be less reliable, providing guidance for the safe use of Gaia colours in crowded environments. We compare the Teff from the Gaia EDR3 colours with those obtained from standard (V-Ks)0 colours for stars in three Galactic globular clusters of different metallicity, namely NGC 104, NGC 6752, and NGC 7099. The agreement between the two estimates of Teff is excellent, with mean differences of between -50 and +50 K, depending on the colour, and with 1$\sigma$ dispersions around the mean Teff differences of 25-50 K for most of the colours and below 10 K for (BP-Ks)0 and (G-Ks)0. This demonstrates that these colours are analogous to (V-Ks)0 as Teff indicators.},

	abstract = {Comparison of 8.4 GHz radio images of a sample of eleven, early-type Seyfert galaxies with previous observations reveals possible variation in the nuclear radio flux density in five of them over a seven year period. Four Seyferts (NGC 2110, NGC 3081, MCG -6-30-15, and NGC 5273) show a decline in their 8.4 GHz nuclear flux density between 1992 and 1999, while one (NGC 4117) shows an increase; the flux densities of the remaining six Seyferts (Mrk 607, NGC 1386, Mrk 620, NGC 3516, NGC 4968, and NGC 7465) have remained constant over this period. New images of MCG -5-23-16 are also presented. We find no correlation between radio variability and nuclear radio luminosity or Seyfert nuclear type, although the sample is small and dominated by type 2 Seyferts. Instead, a possible correlation between the presence of nuclear radio variability and the absence of hundred parsec-scale radio emission is seen, with four out of five marginally resolved or unresolved nuclei showing a change in nuclear flux density, while five out of six extended sources show no nuclear variability despite having unresolved nuclear sources. NGC 2110 is the only source in our sample with significant extended radio structure and strong nuclear variability ({\textasciitilde}38\% decline in nuclear flux density over seven years). The observed nuclear flux variability indicates significant changes are likely to have occurred in the structure of the nucleus on scales smaller than the VLA beam size (i.e., within the central {\textasciitilde}0farcs1 (15 pc)), between the two epochs, possibly due to the appearance and fading of new components or shocks in the jet, consistent with previous detection of subparsec-scale nuclear structure in this Seyfert. Our results suggest that all Seyferts may exhibit variation in their nuclear radio flux density at 8.4 GHz, but that variability is more easily recognized in compact sources in which emission from the variable nucleus is not diluted by unresolved, constant flux density radio jet emission within the central lsim50 pc. If flares in radio light curves correspond to ejection of new relativistic components or emergence of shocks in the underlying flow, improved monitoring and high-resolution imaging using VLBI techniques are required to confirm that radio jets are intrinsically non-relativistic during quiescence but that Seyferts, as black-hole-driven active galactic nuclei (AGN), have the capacity to accelerate relativistic jets during radio flares. Finally, we conclude that our results taken together with the increased detection rate of flat spectrum radio nuclei in Seyferts imaged at VLBI resolutions and the detection of variable water megamaser emission support the paradigm of intermittent periods of quiescence and nuclear outburst across the Seyfert population.},

This field encompasses a physical area of 40{\texttimes}40 pc at a distance of 8 kpc. The completeness limit of the sample at the Galactic center is 1031 ergs s-1 (2.0-8.0 keV), while the detection limit is an order of magnitude lower. The 281 sources detected below 1.5 keV are mainly in the foreground of the Galactic center, while comparisons to the Chandra deep fields at high Galactic latitudes suggest that only about 100 of the observed sources are background AGNs. The surface density of absorbed sources (not detected below 1.5 keV) falls off as 1/$\theta$ away from Sgr A*, in agreement with the distribution of stars in infrared surveys. This demonstrates the X-ray sources trace the general stellar population at the Galactic center. Point sources brighter than our completeness limit produce 10\% of the flux previously attributed to diffuse emission. The logN-logS distribution of the Galactic center sources is extremely steep (power-law slope $\alpha$=1.7). If this distribution extends down to a flux of 10-17 ergs cm-2 s-1 (1029 ergs s-1 at 8 kpc, 2.0-8.0 keV) with the same slope, then point sources would account for all of the previously reported diffuse emission. However, there are numerous diffuse, filamentary structures in the field that also contribute to the total flux, so the 2.0-8.0 keV luminosity distribution must flatten between 1029 and 1031 ergs s-1. Many types of stellar systems should be present in the field at the luminosities to which we are sensitive. However, the spectra of more than half of the Galactic center sources are very hard and can be described by a power law (E-$\Gamma$) with photon index $\Gamma${\textless}1. Such hard spectra have been seen previously only from magnetically accreting white dwarfs (polars and intermediate polars) and wind-accreting neutron stars (pulsars), suggesting that there are large numbers of these systems in our field.},

They can also launch subrelativistic and mildly relativistic outflows and are often assumed to be the sources of short $\gamma$-ray bursts. An electromagnetic signature that persisted for weeks to months after the event would strengthen any future claim of a detection of gravitational waves. Here we present results of calculations showing that the interaction of mildly relativistic outflows with the surrounding medium produces radio flares with peak emission at 1.4 gigahertz that persist at detectable (submillijansky) levels for weeks, out to a redshift of 0.1. Slower subrelativistic outflows produce flares detectable for years at 150 megahertz, as well as at 1.4 gigahertz, from slightly shorter distances. The radio transient RT 19870422 (ref. 11) has the properties predicted by our model, and its most probable origin is the merger of a compact neutron-star/neutron-star binary. The lack of radio detections usually associated with short $\gamma$-ray bursts does not constrain the radio transients that we discuss here (from mildly relativistic and subrelativistic outflows) because short $\gamma$-ray burst redshifts are typically {\textgreater}0.1 and the appropriate timescales (longer than weeks) have not been sampled.},

All but one of the Seyferts show evidence for variability on timescales of minutes to hours, with the amplitude anticorrelated with the source luminosity, confirming previous results. In at least eight sources there is evidence that the variability amplitude below 2 keV is greater than that in the hard X-ray band, perhaps indicating variable components other than the power law in the soft band. Ultrarapid variability, implying significant power at frequencies greater than 10-3 Hz is detected in at least five sources but is difficult to detect in most cases, because of the sampling and signal-to-noise ratio. In Mrk 766 and MCG -6-30-15 there is also an indication that the high-frequency power spectra are variable in shape and/or intensity. There is similar evidence in NGC 4151 but on longer timescales.},

Pulsars exhibit two distinct kinds of variability, called diffractive scintillation and refractive scintillation, on timescales of minutes and weeks respectively.

Our observations span t = 11-570 days post-explosion and a frequency range of 250-1450 MHz. The uGMRT light curves are best modeled as synchrotron emission from an inhomogeneous radio-emitting region expanding into an ionized medium. However, due to the lack of information on the source covering factor, which is a measure of the degree of inhomogeneity, we derive various parameters assuming the source covering factor to be unity. These parameters, hence, indicate limits on the actual values in an inhomogeneous model. We derive the lower limit of the shock radius to be R \~{} (6.1-14.4) {\texttimes} 1016 cm at t = 138-257 days post-explosion. We find that the fast-moving ejecta from the explosion are moving with velocity v {\textgreater} 0.2c up to t = 257 days post-explosion. The upper limits of the mass-loss rate of the progenitor are \${\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\$ \~{} (4.1-1.7) {\texttimes} 10-6 M? yr-1 at (19.3-45.7) years before the explosion for a wind velocity vw = 1000 km s-1. These \${\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\$ values are \~{} 100 times smaller than the previously reported mass-loss rate 2.2 years before the explosion, indicating an enhanced phase of the mass-loss event close to the end-of-life of the progenitor.

However, the radio flux began rising surprisingly late in the outburst, indicating that the bulk of the radio-emitting material was either very cold, or expanding very slowly, for the first {\textasciitilde}50 days of the outburst. Considering a plausible range of volume filling factors and geometries for the ejecta, we find that the high peak flux densities of the radio emission require a massive ejection of (1-30) {\texttimes} 10-5 M ?.

Their high luminosities and short durations require extreme energy densities, such as those found in the vicinity of neutron stars and black holes. Studying the burst intensities and polarimetric properties on a wide range of timescales, from milliseconds down to nanoseconds, is key to understanding the emission mechanism. However, high-time-resolution studies of FRBs are limited by their unpredictable activity levels, available instrumentation and temporal broadening in the intervening ionized medium. Here we show that the repeating FRB 20200120E can produce isolated shots of emission as short as about 60 nanoseconds in duration, with brightness temperatures as high as 3 {\texttimes} 1041 K (excluding relativistic effects), comparable with `nano-shots' from the Crab pulsar. Comparing both the range of timescales and luminosities, we find that FRB 20200120E observationally bridges the gap between known Galactic young pulsars and magnetars and the much more distant extragalactic FRBs. This suggests a common magnetically powered emission mechanism spanning many orders of magnitude in timescale and luminosity. In this Article, we probe a relatively unexplored region of the short-duration transient phase space; we highlight that there probably exists a population of ultrafast radio transients at nanosecond to microsecond timescales, which current FRB searches are insensitive to.},

Here we report the VLBI localization of FRB 20201124A using an ad hoc array of dishes that also participate in the European VLBI Network (EVN). In our campaign, we detected 18 bursts from FRB 20201124A at two separate epochs. By combining the visibilities from both epochs, we were able to localize FRB 20201124A with a 1$\sigma$ uncertainty of 2.7 mas. We use the relatively large burst sample to investigate astrometric accuracy and find that for ?20 baselines (?7 dishes) we can robustly reach milliarcsecond precision even using single-burst data sets. Subarcsecond precision is still possible for single bursts, even when only {\textasciitilde}6 baselines (four dishes) are available. In such cases, the limited uv coverage for individual bursts results in very high side-lobe levels. Thus, in addition to the peak position from the dirty map, we also explore smoothing the structure in the dirty map by fitting Gaussian functions to the fringe pattern in order to constrain individual burst positions, which we find to be more reliable. Our VLBI work places FRB 20201124A 710 {\textpm} 30 mas (1$\sigma$ uncertainty) from the optical center of the host galaxy, consistent with originating from within the recently discovered extended radio structure associated with star formation in the host galaxy. Future high-resolution optical observations, e.g., with Hubble Space Telescope, can determine the proximity of FRB 20201124A's position to nearby knots of star formation.},

Here we report the detection and localization of the repeating FRB 20190520B, which is co-located with a compact, persistent radio source and associated with a dwarf host galaxy of high specific-star-formation rate at a redshift of 0.241 {\textpm} 0.001. The estimated host-galaxy dispersion measure of approximately 903-111+72 parsecs per cubic centimetre, which is nearly an order of magnitude higher than the average of FRB host galaxies2,6, far exceeds the dispersion-measure contribution of the intergalactic medium. Caution is thus warranted in inferring redshifts for FRBs without accurate host-galaxy identifications.},

These sources would have been previously classified as "radio-quiet" quasars based on upper limits from the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty cm survey (1993-2011), but they are now consistent with "radio-loud" quasars ( \$\{L\}\_\{3{\textbackslash}mathrm\{GHz\}\}=\{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{40{\textbackslash}mbox\{--\}42\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{erg\}{\textbackslash},\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{s\}\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ ). A quasi-simultaneous, multiband (\~{}1-18 GHz) follow-up study of 14 sources with the VLA has revealed compact sources ({\textless}0"1 or {\textless}1 kpc) with peaked radio spectral shapes. The high-amplitude variability over decadal timescales at 1.5 GHz (100\% to {\textgreater}2500\%) but roughly steady fluxes over a few months at 3 GHz are inconsistent with extrinsic variability due to propagation effects, thus favoring an intrinsic origin. We conclude that our sources are powerful quasars hosting compact/young jets. This challenges the generally accepted idea that "radio-loudness" is a property of the quasar/AGN population that remains fixed on human timescales. Our study suggests that frequent episodes of short-lived AGN jets that do not necessarily grow to large scales may be common at high redshift. We speculate that intermittent but powerful jets on subgalactic scales could interact with the interstellar medium, possibly driving feedback capable of influencing galaxy evolution.},

	abstract = {Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are powerful cosmic explosions, signaling the death of massive stars. Among them, GRB 221009A is by far the brightest burst ever observed. Because of its enormous energy ( E iso ? 10 55 erg) and proximity ( z ? 0.15), GRB 221009A is an exceptionally rare event that pushes the limits of our theories. We present multiwavelength observations covering the first 3 months of its afterglow evolution. The x-ray brightness decays as a power law with slope ? t -1.66 , which is not consistent with standard predictions for jetted emission. We attribute this behavior to a shallow energy profile of the relativistic jet. A similar trend is observed in other energetic GRBs, suggesting that the most extreme explosions may be powered by structured jets launched by a common central engine. The afterglow of GRB 221009A implies a shallow structured jet is produced in the most powerful stellar explosions.},

	abstract = {We report on the discovery of AT 2018lqh (ZTF 18abfzgpl)-a rapidly evolving extragalactic transient in a star-forming host at 242 Mpc. The transient g-band light curve's duration above a half-maximum light is about 2.1 days, where 0.4/1.7 days are spent on the rise/decay, respectively. The estimated bolometric light curve of this object peaked at about 7 {\texttimes} 1042erg s-1-roughly 7 times brighter than the neutron star (NS)-NS merger event AT 2017gfo. We show that this event can be explained by an explosion with a fast (v {\textasciitilde} 0.08 c) low-mass (?0.07 M ?) ejecta, composed mostly of radioactive elements. For example, ejecta dominated by 56Ni with a timescale of t 0 ? 1.6 days for the ejecta to become optically thin for $\gamma$-rays fits the data well. Such a scenario requires burning at densities that are typically found in the envelopes of neutron stars or the cores of white dwarfs. A combination of circumstellar material (CSM) interaction power at early times and shock cooling at late times is consistent with the photometric observations, but the observed spectrum of the event may pose some challenges for this scenario. We argue that the observations are not consistent with a shock breakout from a stellar envelope, while a model involving a low-mass ejecta ramming into low-mass CSM cannot explain both the early- and late-time observations.},

Using the FIRST radio catalog, I present a search for luminous persistent sources in nearby galaxies, with radio luminosities {\textgreater} 10 \% of the FRB 121102 persistent source luminosity. The galaxy sample contains about 30\% of the total galaxy g-band luminosity within {\textless} 108 Mpc, in a footprint of 10,600 deg2. After rejecting sources likely due to active galactic nuclei activity or background sources, I am left with 11 candidates that are presumably associated with galactic disks or star-formation regions. At least some of these candidates are likely to be due to chance alignment. In addition, I find 85 sources within 1{\textbackslash}prime{\textbackslash}prime of galactic nuclei. Assuming that the radio persistent sources are not related to galactic nuclei and that they follow the galaxy g-band light, the 11 sources imply a 95\% confidence upper limit on the space density of luminous persistent sources of ? 5{\texttimes} \{10\}-5 Mpc-3, and that at any given time only a small fraction of galaxies host a radio-luminous persistent source (? \{10\}-3 \{L\}* -1). Assuming a persistent source lifetime of 100 years, this implies a birth rate of ? 5{\texttimes} \{10\}-7 yr-1 Mpc-3. Given the FRB volumetric rate, and assuming that all FRBs repeat and are associated with persistent radio sources, this sets a lower limit on the rate of FRB events per persistent source of ? 0.8 yr-1.

	abstract = {Many stripped envelope supernovae (SNe) present a signature of high-velocity material responsible for broad absorption lines in the observed spectrum. These include SNe that are associated with long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) and low-luminosity GRBs (llGRBs), and SNe that are not associated with GRBs. Recently it was suggested that this high-velocity material originates from a cocoon that is driven by a relativistic jet. In LGRBs, this jet breaks out successfully from the stellar envelope, while in llGRBs and SNe that are not associated with GRBs the jet is choked. Here we use numerical simulations to explore the velocity distribution of an outflow that is driven by a choked jet, and its dependence on the jet and progenitor properties. We find that in all cases where the jet is not choked too deep within the star, the outflow carries a roughly constant amount of energy per logarithmic scale of proper velocity over a wide range of velocities, which depends mostly on the cocoon volume at the time of its breakout. This is a universal property of jets driven outflows, which does not exist in outflows of spherically symmetric explosions or when the jets are choked very deep within the star. We therefore conclude that jets that are choked (not too deep) provide a natural explanation to the fast material seen in the early spectra of stripped envelope SNe that are not associated with LGRBs, and that properties of this material could reveal information on the otherwise hidden jets.},

The inspiral of these systems is of utmost astrophysical importance as prodigious producers of gravitational waves and in their possible role in energetic electromagnetic events. We study such binary black hole coalescence under the influence of an external magnetic field produced by the expected circumbinary disk surrounding them. Solving the Einstein equations to describe the spacetime and using the force-free approach for the electromagnetic fields and the tenuous plasma, we present numerical evidence for possible jets driven by these systems. Extending the process described by Blandford and Znajek for a single spinning black hole, the picture that emerges suggests the electromagnetic field extracts energy from the orbiting black holes, which ultimately merge and settle into the standard Blandford-Znajek scenario. Emissions along dual and single jets would be expected that could be observable to large distances.},

The Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations presented here show that the PTF11qcj GHz radio ejecta remains marginally resolved at the submilliarcsecond level ?7.5 yr after the explosion, pointing toward a nonrelativistic expansion. Our VLBI observations thus favor a scenario in which the second peak of the PTF11qcj radio light curve is related to the strong interaction of the supernova ejecta with a circumstellar medium of variable density, rather than to the emergence of an off-axis jet. Continued VLBI monitoring of PTF11qcj in the radio may further strengthen this conclusion.},

However, a white dwarf accreting from a relatively low mass companion via a sufficiently high efficiency ({\textgreater}60\%-80\%) Roche lobe overflow is still consistent with our limits. The ``double-degenerate'' merger scenario also cannot be excluded.},

	abstract = {The tidal disruption of a star by a supermassive black hole can result in transient radio emission. The electrons producing these synchrotron radio flares could either be accelerated inside a relativistic jet or externally by shocks resulting from an outflow interacting with the circumnuclear medium. Until now, evidence for the internal emission mechanism has been lacking; nearly all tidal disruption flare studies have adopted the external shock model to explain the observed properties of radio flares. Here we report a result that presents a challenge to external emission models: we discovered a cross-correlation between the soft X-ray (0.3-1 keV) and 16 GHz radio flux of the tidal disruption flare ASASSN-14li. Variability features in the X-ray light curve appear again in the radio light curve, but after a time lag of \{12\}-5+6 days. This demonstrates that the soft X-ray-emitting accretion disk regulates the radio emission. This coupling appears to be inconsistent with all previous external emission models for this source but is naturally explained if the radio emission originates from a freely expanding jet. We show that emission internal to an adiabatically expanding jet can also reproduce the observed evolution of the radio spectral energy distribution. Furthermore, both the correlation between X-ray and radio luminosity as well as our radio spectral modeling imply an approximately linear coupling between the accretion rate and jet power.},

	abstract = {The brightest fast blue optical transients (FBOTs) are mysterious extragalactic explosions that may represent a new astrophysical phenomenon1. Their fast time to maximum brightness of less than a week, decline over several months, and atypical optical spectra and evolution are difficult to explain within the context of the core collapse of massive stars, which are powered by radioactive decay of 56Ni and evolve more slowly2,3. AT2018cow (at a redshift of 0.014) is an extreme FBOT in terms of rapid evolution and high luminosity4-7. Here we present evidence for a high-amplitude quasiperiodic oscillation of AT2018cow's soft X-rays with a frequency of 224 Hz (at a 3.7$\sigma$ significance level or false alarm probability of 0.02\%) and fractional root-mean-squared amplitude of {\textgreater}30\%. This signal is found in the average power density spectrum taken over the entire 60-day outburst and suggests a highly persistent signal that lasts for a billion cycles. The high frequency (rapid timescale) of 224 Hz (4.4 ms) argues for a compact object in AT2018cow, which could be a neutron star or black hole with a mass less than 850 solar masses. If the quasiperiodic oscillation is equivalent to the spin period of a neutron star, we can set limits on the star's magnetic field strength. Our work highlights a new way of using high-time-resolution X-ray observations to study FBOTs.},

Our main results are as follows: (1) The long-term X-ray light curve of Sw J2058+05 shows a remarkably similar trend to that of Sw J1644+57. After a prolonged power-law decay, the X-ray flux drops off rapidly by a factor of ?160 within a span of $\Delta$t/t<=slant 0.95 . Associating this sudden decline with the transition from super-Eddington to sub-Eddington accretion, we estimate the black hole mass to be in the range of 104-6 M? . (2) We detect rapid (?500 s) X-ray variability before the drop-off, suggesting that, even at late times, the X-rays originate from close to the black hole (ruling out a forward-shock origin). (3) We confirm using Hubble Space Telescope and Very Long Baseline Array astrometry that the location of the source coincides with the galaxy{\textquoteright}s center to within ?400 pc (in projection). (4) We modeled Sw J2058+05's UVOIR spectral energy distribution with a single-temperature blackbody and find that while the radius remains more or less constant at a value of 63.4 {\textpm} 4.5 AU (\~{} \{\{10\}15\} cm) at all times during the outburst, the blackbody temperature drops significantly from \~{}30,000 K at early times to a value of \~{}15,000 K at late times (before the X-ray drop-off).

Four SAVs have been identified between 1980 and 2020 in the long-term radio monitoring data of the blazar PKS 1413 + 135. We show that all four can be fitted with the same, unchanging, gravitational lens model. If SAV is due to gravitational milli-lensing, PKS 1413 + 135 provides a unique system for studying active galactic nuclei with unprecedented microarcsecond resolution, as well as for studying the nature of the milli-lens itself. We discuss two possible candidates for the putative milli-lens: a giant molecular cloud hosted in the intervening edge-on spiral galaxy, and an undetected dwarf galaxy with a massive black hole. We find a significant dependence of SAV crossing time on frequency, which could indicate a fast shock moving in a slower underlying flow. We also find tentative evidence for a 989 day periodicity in the SAVs, which, if real, makes possible the prediction of future SAVs: the next three windows for possible SAVs begin in 2022 August, 2025 May, and 2028 February.},

When in binaries, they make up the dominant form of compact object binary within the Galaxy and can offer insight into different aspects of binary formation and evolution. One of the most remarkable white dwarf binary systems identified to date is AR Scorpii (AR Sco). AR Sco is composed of an M dwarf star and a rapidly spinning white dwarf in a 3.56 h orbit. It shows pulsed emission with a period of 1.97 min over a broad range of wavelengths, which led to it being known as a white dwarf pulsar. Both the pulse mechanism and the evolutionary origin of AR Sco provide challenges to theoretical models. Here we report the discovery of a sibling of AR Sco, J191213.72-441045.1, which harbours a white dwarf in a 4.03 h orbit with an M dwarf and exhibits pulsed emission with a period of 5.30 min.

	abstract = {Rapidly evolving transients, or objects that rise and fade in brightness on timescales two to three times shorter than those of typical Type Ia or Type II supernovae (SNe), have uncertain progenitor systems and powering mechanisms. Recent studies have noted similarities between rapidly evolving transients and Type Ibn SNe, which are powered by ejecta interacting with He-rich circumstellar material (CSM). In this work we present multiband photometric and spectroscopic observations from Las Cumbres Observatory and Swift of four fast-evolving Type Ibn SNe. We compare these observations with those of rapidly evolving transients identified in the literature. We discuss several common characteristics between these two samples, including their light curve and color evolution as well as their spectral features. To investigate a common powering mechanism we construct a grid of analytical model light curves with luminosity inputs from CSM interaction as well as 56Ni radioactive decay. We find that models with ejecta masses of ?1-3 M ?, CSM masses of ?0.2-1 M ?, and CSM radii of ?20-65 au can explain the diversity of peak luminosities, rise times, and decline rates observed in Type Ibn SNe and rapidly evolving transients. This suggests that a common progenitor system-the core collapse of a high-mass star within a dense CSM shell-can reproduce the light curves of even the most luminous and fast-evolving objects, such as AT 2018cow. This work is one of the first to reproduce the light curves of both SNe Ibn and other rapidly evolving transients with a single model.},

It differs conceptually from previous models by occurring through rare, localized underdense sheets. Such sheets are thermally and kinematically stable, and could be consequences of reconnection.

Our observations represent, together with JVLA observations of SNe 2011fe and 2014J, the most sensitive radio studies of Type Ia SNe ever. By combining data and a proper modeling of the radio emission, we constrain the mass-loss rate from the progenitor system of SN 2014J to {\textbackslash}dot\{M\} ? 7.0{\texttimes} 10-10 \{ \{M? yr-1\}\} (for a wind speed of 100 km s-1). If the medium around the supernova is uniform, then n ISM {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 1.3 cm-3, which is the most stringent limit for the (uniform) density around a Type Ia SN. Our deep upper limits favor a double-degenerate (DD) scenario{\textemdash}involving two WD stars{\textemdash}for the progenitor system of SN 2014J, as such systems have less circumstellar gas than our upper limits. By contrast, most single-degenerate (SD) scenarios, i.e., the wide family of progenitor systems where a red giant, main-sequence, or sub-giant star donates mass to an exploding WD, are ruled out by our observations. (While completing our work, we noticed that a paper by Margutti et al. was submitted to The Astrophysical Journal. From a non-detection of X-ray emission from SN 2014J, the authors obtain limits of {\textbackslash}dot\{M\} ? 1.2 {\texttimes} 10-9 M ? yr-1 (for a wind speed of 100 km s-1) and n ISM {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 3.5 cm-3, for the $\rho$vpropr -2 wind and constant density cases, respectively. As these limits are less constraining than ours, the findings by Margutti et al. do not alter our conclusions. The X-ray results are, however, important to rule out free-free and synchrotron self-absorption as a reason for the radio non-detections.) Our estimates on the limits on the gas density surrounding SN2011fe, using the flux density limits from Chomiuk et al., agree well with their results. Although we discuss the possibilities of an SD scenario passing observational tests, as well as uncertainties in the modeling of the radio emission, the evidence from SNe 2011fe and 2014J points in the direction of a DD scenario for both.},

	abstract = {We present multiwavelength observations of the afterglow of GRB 130427A, the brightest (in total fluence) gamma-ray burst (GRB) of the past 29 yr. Optical spectroscopy from Gemini-North reveals the redshift of the GRB to be z = 0.340, indicating that its unprecedented brightness is primarily the result of its relatively close proximity to Earth; the intrinsic luminosities of both the GRB and its afterglow are not extreme in comparison to other bright GRBs. We present a large suite of multiwavelength observations spanning from 300 s to 130 days after the burst and demonstrate that the afterglow shows relatively simple, smooth evolution at all frequencies, with no significant late-time flaring or rebrightening activity. The entire data set from 1 GHz to 10 GeV can be modeled as synchrotron emission from a combination of reverse and forward shocks in good agreement with the standard afterglow model, providing strong support to the applicability of the underlying theory and clarifying the nature of the GeV emission observed to last for minutes to hours following other very bright GRBs. A tenuous, wind-stratified circumburst density profile is required by the observations, suggesting a massive-star progenitor with a low mass-loss rate, perhaps due to low metallicity. GRBs similar in nature to GRB 130427A, inhabiting low-density media and exhibiting strong reverse shocks, are probably not uncommon but may have been difficult to recognize in the past owing to their relatively faint late-time radio emission; more such events should be found in abundance by the new generation of sensitive radio and millimeter instruments.},

	abstract = {Wide-field optical surveys have begun to uncover large samples of fast (trise ? 5 d), luminous (Mpeak {\textless} -18), blue transients. While commonly attributed to the breakout of a supernova shock into a dense wind, the great distances to the transients of this class found so far have hampered detailed investigation of their properties. We present photometry and spectroscopy from a comprehensive worldwide campaign to observe AT 2018cow (ATLAS 18qqn), the first fast-luminous optical transient to be found in real time at low redshift. Our first spectra ({\textless}2 days after discovery) are entirely featureless. A very broad absorption feature suggestive of near-relativistic velocities develops between 3 and 8 days, then disappears. Broad emission features of H and He develop after {\textgreater}10 days. The spectrum remains extremely hot throughout its evolution, and the photospheric radius contracts with time (receding below R {\textless} 1014 cm after 1 month). This behaviour does not match that of any known supernova, although a relativistic jet within a fallback supernova could explain some of the observed features. Alternatively, the transient could originate from the disruption of a star by an intermediate-mass black hole, although this would require long-lasting emission of highly super-Eddington thermal radiation. In either case, AT 2018cow suggests that the population of fast luminous transients represents a new class of astrophysical event. Intensive follow-up of this event in its late phases, and of any future events found at comparable distance, will be essential to better constrain their origins.},

	abstract = {The optical afterglow of long-duration GRB 071003 is among the brightest yet to be detected from any GRB, with R ? 12 mag in KAIT observations starting 42 s after the GRB trigger, including filtered detections during prompt emission. However, our high-S/N afterglow spectrum displays only extremely weak absorption lines at what we argue is the host redshift of z = 1.60435, in contrast to the three other, much stronger Mg II absorption systems observed at lower redshifts. Together with Keck adaptive optics observations, which fail to reveal a host galaxy coincident with the burst position, our observations suggest a halo progenitor and offer a cautionary tale about the use of Mg II for GRB redshift determination. We present early- through late-time observations spanning the electromagnetic spectrum, constrain the connection between the prompt emission and early variations in the light curve (we observe no correlation), and discuss possible origins for an unusual, marked rebrightening that occurs a few hours after the burst: likely either a late-time refreshed shock or a wide-angle secondary jet. Analysis of the late-time afterglow is most consistent with a wind environment, suggesting a massive star progenitor. Together with GRB 070125, this may indicate that a small but significant portion of star formation in the early universe occurred far outside what we consider a normal galactic disk.},

	abstract = {The many unusual properties of the enigmatic AT2018cow suggested that at least some subset of the empirical class of fast blue optical transients (FBOTs) represents a genuinely new astrophysical phenomenon. Unfortunately, the intrinsic rarity and fleeting nature of these events have made it difficult to identify additional examples early enough to acquire the observations necessary to constrain theoretical models. We present here the Zwicky Transient Facility discovery of AT2020xnd (ZTF20acigmel, the 'Camel') at z = 0.243, the first unambiguous AT2018cow analogue to be found and confirmed in real time. AT2018cow and AT2020xnd share all key observational properties: a fast optical rise, sustained high photospheric temperature, absence of a second peak attributable to ejection of a radioactively heated stellar envelope, extremely luminous radio, millimetre, and X-ray emission, and a dwarf-galaxy host. This supports the argument that AT2018cow-like events represent a distinct phenomenon from slower-evolving radio-quiet supernovae, likely requiring a different progenitor or a different central engine. The sample properties of the four known members of this class to date disfavour tidal disruption models but are consistent with the alternative model of an accretion powered jet following the direct collapse of a massive star to a black hole. Contextual filtering of alert streams combined with rapid photometric verification using multiband imaging provides an efficient way to identify future members of this class, even at high redshift.},

	abstract = {We report measurements of the mass density, $\Omega$M, and cosmological-constant energy density, $\Omega$$\Lambda$, of the universe based on the analysis of 42 type Ia supernovae discovered by the Supernova Cosmology Project. The magnitude-redshift data for these supernovae, at redshifts between 0.18 and 0.83, are fitted jointly with a set of supernovae from the Cal{\'a}n/Tololo Supernova Survey, at redshifts below 0.1, to yield values for the cosmological parameters. All supernova peak magnitudes are standardized using a SN Ia light-curve width-luminosity relation. The measurement yields a joint probability distribution of the cosmological parameters that is approximated by the relation 0.8$\Omega$M-0.6$\Omega$$\Lambda${\textasciitilde}-0.2+/-0.1 in the region of interest ($\Omega$M{\textless}{\textasciitilde}1.5). For a flat ($\Omega$M+$\Omega$$\Lambda$=1) cosmology we find $\Omega$flatM=0.28+0.09-0.08 (1 $\sigma$ statistical) +0.05-0.04 (identified systematics). The data are strongly inconsistent with a $\Lambda$=0 flat cosmology, the simplest inflationary universe model. An open, $\Lambda$=0 cosmology also does not fit the data well: the data indicate that the cosmological constant is nonzero and positive, with a confidence of P($\Lambda${\textgreater}0)=99\%, including the identified systematic uncertainties. The best-fit age of the universe relative to the Hubble time is tflat0=14.9+1.4-1.1(0.63/h) Gyr for a flat cosmology. The size of our sample allows us to perform a variety of statistical tests to check for possible systematic errors and biases. We find no significant differences in either the host reddening distribution or Malmquist bias between the low-redshift Cal{\'a}n/Tololo sample and our high-redshift sample. Excluding those few supernovae that are outliers in color excess or fit residual does not significantly change the results. The conclusions are also robust whether or not a width-luminosity relation is used to standardize the supernova peak magnitudes. We discuss and constrain, where possible, hypothetical alternatives to a cosmological constant.},

In our 2019 review on the subject, we presented a growing, but still mysterious, population of FRBs{\textemdash}60 unique sources, 2 repeating FRBs, and only 1 identified host galaxy. However, in only a few short years, new observations and discoveries have given us a wealth of information about these sources. The total FRB population now stands at over 600 published sources, 24 repeaters, and 19 host galaxies. Higher time resolution data, sustained monitoring, and precision localisations have given us insight into repeaters, host galaxies, burst morphology, source activity, progenitor models, and the use of FRBs as cosmological probes. The recent detection of a bright FRB-like burst from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935 + 2154 provides an important link between FRBs and magnetars. There also continue to be surprising discoveries, like periodic modulation of activity from repeaters and the localisation of one FRB source to a relatively nearby globular cluster associated with the M81 galaxy. In this review, we summarise the exciting observational results from the past few years. We also highlight their impact on our understanding of the FRB population and proposed progenitor models. We build on the introduction to FRBs in our earlier review, update our readers on recent results, and discuss interesting avenues for exploration as the field enters a new regime where hundreds to thousands of new FRBs will be discovered and reported each year.},

More than 3,000 pulsars are currently known, including especially more than 200 of them studied at gamma-ray frequencies. By putting recent insights into the pulsar magnetosphere in a historical context and by comparing them to key observational features at radio and high-energy frequencies, we show the following: Magnetospheric structure of young energetic pulsars is now understood. Limitations still exist for old nonrecycled and millisecond pulsars. The observed high-energy radiation is likely produced in the magnetospheric current sheet beyond the light cylinder. There are at least two different radio emission mechanisms. One operates in the inner magnetosphere, whereas the other one works near the light cylinder and is specific to pulsars with the high magnetic field strength in that region. Radio emission from the inner magnetosphere is intrinsically connected to the process of pair production, and its observed properties contain the imprint of both the geometry and propagation effects through the magnetospheric plasma.We discuss the limitations of our understanding and identify a range of observed phenomena and physical processes that still await explanation in thefuture. This includes connecting the magnetospheric processes to spin-down properties to explain braking and possible evolution of spin orientation, building a first-principles model of radio emission and quantitative connections with observations.},

During the last decade, several space missions{\textemdash}BATSE (Burst and Transient Source Experiment) on the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory, BeppoSAX and now HETE II (High-Energy Transient Explorer){\textemdash}together with ground-based optical, infrared, and radio observatories have revolutionized our understanding of GRB{\textquoteright}s, showing that they are cosmological, that they are accompanied by long-lasting afterglows, and that they are associated with core-collapse supernovae. At the same time a theoretical understanding has emerged in the form of the fireball internal-external shocks model. According to this model GRB{\textquoteright}s are produced when the kinetic energy of an ultrarelativistic flow is dissipated in internal collisions. The afterglow arises when the flow is slowed down by shocks with the surrounding circumburst matter. This model has had numerous successful predictions, like the predictions of the afterglow itself, of jet breaks in the afterglow light curve, and of the optical flash that accompanies the GRB{\textquoteright}s. This review focuses on the current theoretical understanding of the physical processes believed to take place in GRB{\textquoteright}s.},

	abstract = {After decades of extensive research the mechanism driving core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) is still unclear. One common mechanism is a neutrino-driven outflow, but others have been proposed. Among those, a long-standing idea is that jets play an important role in supernova (SN) explosions. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) that accompany {\textquotedblleft}hypernovae,{\textquotedblright} rare and powerful CCSNe, involve relativistic jets. A GRB jet punches a hole in the stellar envelope and produces the observed gamma-rays far outside the progenitor star. While SNe and jets coexist in long GRBs (LGRBs), the relationship between the mechanisms driving the hypernova and the jet is unknown. Also unclear is the relationship between the rare hypernovae and the more common CCSNe. Here we present observational evidence that indicates that choked jets are active in CCSNe that are not associated with GRBs. A choked jet deposits all its energy in a cocoon. The cocoon eventually breaks out from the star, releasing energetic material at very high, yet sub-relativistic, velocities. This fast-moving material engulfs the star leading to a unique detectable very broad line absorption signature in early time SN spectra. We find a clear evidence for this signature in several CCSNe, all involving progenitors that have lost all, or most, of their hydrogen envelope prior to the explosion. These include CCSNe that do not harbor GRBs or any other relativistic outflows. Our findings suggest a continuum of central engine activities in different types of CCSNe and call for rethinking of the explosion mechanism of CCSNe.},

Combining these data with those of three other eclipsing systems we study the frequency dependence of the eclipse duration. PSRs B1957+20 and J1816+4510 have similar orbital properties, but the companions to the pulsars have masses that differ by an order of magnitude. A dedicated campaign to simultaneously observe the pulsed and imaged continuum flux densities throughout the eclipses reveals many similarities between the excess material within the two binaries, irrespective of the companion star properties. The observations show that the pulsar fluxes are removed from the line of sight throughout the main body of the eclipses. For PSR J1816 + 4510, we present the first direct evidence of an eclipse mechanism that transitions from one that removes the pulsar flux from the line of sight to one that merely smears out pulsations, and claim that this is a consequence of scattering in a tail of material flowing behind the companion. Inferred mass-loss rates from the companion stars are found to be \${\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{C\}\} {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{-12\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}sim 2 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-13\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ yr-1 for PSR B1957+20 and PSR J1816 + 4510, respectively; seemingly too low to evaporate the stars within Hubble time. Measurements of eclipse durations over a wide range of radio frequencies show a significant dependence of eclipse duration on frequency for all pulsars, with wider eclipses at lower frequencies. These results provide a marked improvement in the observational constraints available for theoretical studies of the eclipse mechanisms.},

It is characterized by a high peak luminosity (\~{}1.7 {\texttimes} 1044 erg s-1), rapidly evolving light curves ({\textgreater}5 mag rise to peak in \~{}3.5 days), and hot blackbody spectra, peaking at \~{}27,000 K that are relatively featureless and unchanging over the first two weeks. The bolometric light curve cannot be powered by radioactive decay under realistic assumptions. The detection of high-energy emission may suggest a central engine as the powering source. Using a magnetar model, we estimated an ejected mass of 0.1-0.4 M \{\}? , which lies between that of low-energy core-collapse events and the kilonova, AT2017gfo. The spectra cooled rapidly from 27,000 to 15,000 K in just over two weeks but remained smooth and featureless. Broad and shallow emission lines appear after about 20 days, and we tentatively identify them as He I although they would be redshifted from their rest wavelengths.

More importantly, the multicolor excess in the afterglow detected in the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) light curves is compelling observational evidence of an underlying supernova. Here we present near-infrared and radio observations of the afterglow, and from our comprehensive afterglow modeling, we find evidence favoring a wind-fed circumburst medium. Lacking X-ray data, we are unable to conclusively measure the mass-loss rate, M, but obtain an estimate, M{\textasciitilde}2{\texttimes}10-7/vw3 Msolar yr-1, where vw3 is the speed of the wind from the progenitor in units of 103 km s-1. This M is similar to that inferred for the progenitor of the Type Ibc supernova SN 1998bw that has been associated with the peculiar burst GRB 980425. Our data, taken in conjunction with the HST results of Bloom et al., provide a consistent picture: the long-duration GRB 011121 had a massive star progenitor that exploded as a supernova at about the same time as the gamma-ray burst event. Finally, we note that the gamma-ray profile of GRB 011121 is similar to that of GRB 980425.},

Here we report the discovery of the afterglow of this unique burst. In order to simultaneously fit our radio and optical observations, we are required to invoke a model involving a hard electron distribution, p{\textasciitilde}1.5, and a jet-break time less than 1.5 days. A spectrum of the host galaxy taken 111 days after the burst reveals a single emission line, interpreted as [O II] at a redshift z=1.0585, and a continuum break that we interpret as the Balmer limit at this redshift. Despite the long T90, the afterglow of GRB 000911 is not unusual in any other way when compared to the set of afterglows studied to date. We conclude that the duration of the GRB plays little part in determining the physics of the afterglow. Partially based on observations obtained at the W. M.

The data we analyse include Stokes I and V polarization products to an RMS sensitivity of 250 $\mu$Jy PSF-1. We searched RACS for sources with fractional circular polarization above 6 per cent, and after excluding imaging artefacts, polarization leakage, and known pulsars we identified radio emission coincident with 33 known stars. These range from M-dwarfs through to magnetic, chemically peculiar A- and B-type stars. Some of these are well-known radio stars such as YZ CMi and CU Vir, but 23 have no previous radio detections. We report the flux density and derived brightness temperature of these detections and discuss the nature of the radio emission.

Recently, a new such source named ILT J1101+5521 was discovered, which is in a white dwarf (WD){\textendash}red dwarf (RD) binary system, with the observed 125.5 minutes period in radio emission being identified as the orbital period and the radio emission occurs at the inferior conjunction of the WD. We suggest that the radio emission properties of the system can be well explained within the framework of the unipolar inductor magnetic interaction model between the magnetized WD and the RD with low magnetization, with a relativistic version of electron cyclotron maser emission being the most likely radiation mechanism. We suggest that this mechanism can interpret at least some long-period radio transients, especially the ultra-long-period subpopulation. Within this model, high energy emission in X-rays via relativistically boosted cyclotron radiation and $\gamma$-rays via inverse Compton scattering off stellar light are expected, but the predicted luminosities are relatively low. This model likely applies to the ultra-long-period population of LPRTs. The short-period population of LPRTs is likely powered by other engines, such as slow magnetars.},

	abstract = {Ephemeral Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) must be powered by some of the most energetic processes in the Universe. That makes them highly interesting in their own right, and as precise probes for estimating cosmological parameters. This field thus poses a unique challenge: FRBs must be detected promptly and immediately localised and studied based only on that single millisecond-duration flash. The problem is that the burst occurrence is highly unpredictable and that their distance strongly suppresses their brightness. Since the discovery of FRBs in single-dish archival data in 2007, detection software has evolved tremendously. Pipelines now detect bursts in real time within a matter of seconds, operate on interferometers, buffer high-time and frequency resolution data, and issue real-time alerts to other observatories for rapid multi-wavelength follow-up. In this paper, we review the components that comprise a FRB search software pipeline, we discuss the proven techniques that were adopted from pulsar searches, we highlight newer, more efficient techniques for detecting FRBs, and we conclude by discussing the proposed novel future methodologies that may power the search for FRBs in the era of big data astronomy.},

It is located at the center of a galaxy (SDSS J153350.89+272729) at 147 Mpc, which shows weak Type II Seyfert activity.

This is only the second TDE candidate to be first discovered at radio wavelengths. Its luminosity fills a gap between the radio afterglows of subrelativistic TDEs in the local universe, and relativistic TDEs at high redshifts. The unusual properties of FIRST J153350.8+272729 (ongoing nuclear activity in the host galaxy, high radio luminosity) motivate more extensive TDE searches in untargeted radio surveys.},

The 16 FRB hosts identified thus far span three orders of magnitude in mass and specific star formation rate, implicating a ubiquitously occurring progenitor object. FRBs localized with {\textasciitilde}arcsecond accuracy also enable effective searches for associated multiwavelength and multi-time-scale counterparts, such as the persistent radio source associated with FRB 20121102A. Here we present a localization of the repeating source FRB 20201124A, and its association with a host galaxy (SDSS J050803.48+260338.0, z = 0.098) and persistent radio source. The galaxy is massive (\$\{{\textbackslash}sim\}3{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}text\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$), star-forming (few solar masses per year), and dusty. Very Large Array and Very Long Baseline Array observations of the persistent radio source measure a luminosity of 1.2 {\texttimes} 1029 erg s-1 Hz-1, and show that is extended on scales ?50 mas. We associate this radio emission with the ongoing star formation activity in SDSS J050803.48+260338.0. Deeper, high-resolution optical observations are required to better utilize the milliarcsecond-scale localization of FRB 20201124A and determine the origin of the large dispersion measure (150-220 pc cm-3) contributed by the host. SDSS J050803.48+260338.0 is an order of magnitude more massive than any galaxy or stellar system previously associated with a repeating FRB source, but is comparable to the hosts of so far non-repeating FRBs, further building the link between the two apparent populations.},

Its radio emission and 18 min periodicity led the source to be tentatively interpreted as an extreme magnetar or a peculiar highly magnetic white dwarf. The source was not detected in the 0.3-8 keV energy range with a 3$\sigma$ upper limit on the count rate of 3 {\texttimes} 10-4 counts s-1. No radio emission was detected during our X-ray observations either. Furthermore, we studied the field around GLEAM-X J1627 using archival European Southern Observatory and DECam Plane Survey data, as well as recent Southern African Large Telescope observations. Many sources are present close to the position of GLEAM-X J1627, but only two within the 2' radio position uncertainty. Depending on the assumed spectral distribution, the upper limits converted to an X-ray luminosity of L X {\textless} 6.5 {\texttimes} 1029 erg s-1 for a blackbody with temperature kT = 0.3 keV, or L X {\textless} 9 {\texttimes} 1029 erg s-1 for a power law with photon index $\Gamma$ = 2 (assuming a 1.3 kpc distance). Furthermore, we performed magneto-thermal simulations for neutron stars considering crust- and core-dominated field configurations. Based on our multiband limits, we conclude that (i) in the magnetar scenario, the X-ray upper limits suggest that GLEAM-X J1627 should be older than {\textasciitilde}1 Myr, unless it has a core-dominated magnetic field or has experienced fast cooling; (ii) in the white dwarf scenario, we can rule out most binary systems, a hot sub-dwarf, and a hot magnetic isolated white dwarf (T ? 10.000 K), while a cold isolated white dwarf is still compatible with our limits.},

Their bright radio emission resembles that of radio magnetars, but their long periodicities and lack of detection at other wavelengths challenge the neutron star (NS) interpretation. In contrast, long rotational periods are common in white dwarfs (WDs) but, although predicted, dipolar radio emission from isolated magnetic WDs has never been unambiguously observed. In this work, we investigate these long-period objects as potential isolated NS or WD dipolar radio emitters and find that both scenarios pose significant challenges to our understanding of radio emission via pair production in dipolar magnetospheres. We also perform population-synthesis simulations based on dipolar spin-down in both pictures, assuming different initial-period distributions, masses, radii, beaming fractions, and magnetic field prescriptions, to assess their impact on the ultra-long pulsar population. In the NS scenario, we do not expect a large number of ultra-long-period pulsars under any physically motivated (or even extreme) assumptions for the period evolution. On the other hand, in the WD scenario, we can easily accommodate a large population of long-period radio emitters. However, no mechanism can easily explain the production of such bright coherent radio emission in either scenarios.},

	abstract = {Pulsar timing arrays aim to detect nanohertz-frequency gravitational waves (GWs). A background of GWs modulates pulsar arrival times and manifests as a stochastic process, common to all pulsars, with a signature spatial correlation. Here we describe a search for an isotropic stochastic gravitational-wave background (GWB) using observations of 30 millisecond pulsars from the third data release of the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA), which spans 18 yr. Using current Bayesian inference techniques we recover and characterize a common-spectrum noise process. Represented as a strain spectrum \$\{h\}\_\{c\}=A\{(f/1\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{yr\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\})\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}alpha \}\$ , we measure \$A=\{3.1\}\_\{-0.9\}{\textasciicircum}\{+1.3\}{\textbackslash}times \{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{-15\}\$ and $\alpha$ = -0.45 {\textpm} 0.20, respectively (median and 68\% credible interval). For a spectral index of $\alpha$ = -2/3, corresponding to an isotropic background of GWs radiated by inspiraling supermassive black hole binaries, we recover an amplitude of \$A=\{2.04\}\_\{-0.22\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.25\}{\textbackslash}times \{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{-15\}\$ . However, we demonstrate that the apparent signal strength is time-dependent, as the first half of our data set can be used to place an upper limit on A that is in tension with the inferred common-spectrum amplitude using the complete data set. We search for spatial correlations in the observations by hierarchically analyzing individual pulsar pairs, which also allows for significance validation through randomizing pulsar positions on the sky. For a process with $\alpha$ = -2/3, we measure spatial correlations consistent with a GWB, with an estimated false-alarm probability of p ? 0.02 (approx. 2$\sigma$). The long timing baselines of the PPTA and the access to southern pulsars will continue to play an important role in the International Pulsar Timing Array.},

	abstract = {Orphan afterglows are transient events that are produced by cosmological fireballs and resemble gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows yet are not accompanied by gamma rays. Such transients may be produced by jetlike GRBs observed off-axis and therefore hold great promise as a test of GRB collimation. However, orphans may also be produced by ``dirty fireballs,'' i.e., cosmological fireballs whose ejecta carry too many baryons to produce a GRB. A well-designed orphan afterglow search can distinguish between on-axis dirty fireballs and off-axis orphans in at least two ways. First, by combining real-time triggers from a wide-area, multicolor search with deeper follow-up observations, the light curve can be tracked for a time {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}2t1, where t1 is the age of the event at first observation. Such a light curve allows simultaneous fits to t1 and the time decay slope $\alpha$ with sufficient accuracy to distinguish on- and off-axis orphans. Second, radio follow-up of orphan afterglows will show whether the radio flux is falling in time (as expected for an off-axis orphan) or not (as expected for on-axis events). Additional tests involving multiband monitoring of the cooling, self-absorption, and f$\nu$ peak frequencies are also possible, although they are much more observationally demanding. A further complication in orphan searches is that dirty fireballs are likely to also be collimated and that collimated dirty fireballs viewed off-axis will individually be practically indistinguishable from off-axis GRB afterglows. To recognize their presence, orphan afterglow surveys must be sufficiently extensive to catch at least some dirty fireballs on-axis.},

We report on observations made of FRB 20121102A with the MeerKAT radio telescope. Across five epochs, we detect the PRS associated with FRB 20121102A. Our observations are split into a cluster of four epochs (MJD 58732-58764) and a separate single epoch about 1000 d later. The measured flux density is constant across the first four observations but then decays by more than one-third in the final observation. Our observations on MJD 58736 coincided with the detections of 11 bursts from FRB 20121102A by the MeerTRAP backend, seven of which we detected in the image plane. We discuss the importance of image plane detections when considering the commensal transient searches being performed with MeerKAT and other radio facilities. We find that MeerKAT is so sensitive that within a 2-s image, we can detect any FRB with a flux density above 2.4 mJy at 1.3 GHz and so could localize every FRB that has been detected by CHIME to date.},

Our observations span the first 475 d post-burst and three orders of magnitude in observing frequency, from 0.15 to 230 GHz. By combining our new observations with those available in the literature, we have the most detailed radio data set in terms of cadence and spectral coverage of any GRB to date, which we use to explore the spectral and temporal evolution of the afterglow. By testing a series of phenomenological models, we find that three separate synchrotron components best explain the afterglow. The high temporal and spectral resolution allows us to conclude that standard analytical afterglow models are unable to explain the observed evolution of GRB 221009A. We explore where the discrepancies between the observations and the models are most significant and place our findings in the context of the most well-studied GRB radio afterglows to date. Our observations are best explained by three synchrotron-emitting regions that we interpret as a forward shock, a reverse shock, and an additional shock potentially from a cocoon or wider outflow. Finally, we find that our observations do not show any evidence of any late-time spectral or temporal changes that could result from a jet break but note that any lateral structure could significantly affect a jet break signature.},

	abstract = {The Large Area Telescope (LAT) aboard the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope provides an unprecedented opportunity to study gamma-ray blazars. To capitalize on this opportunity, beginning in late 2007, about a year before the start of LAT science operations, we began a large-scale, fast-cadence 15 GHz radio monitoring program with the 40 m telescope at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory. This program began with the 1158 northern ($\delta$ {\textgreater} -20{\textdegree}) sources from the Candidate Gamma-ray Blazar Survey and now encompasses over 1500 sources, each observed twice per week with about 4 mJy (minimum) and 3\% (typical) uncertainty. Here, we describe this monitoring program and our methods, and present radio light curves from the first two years (2008 and 2009). As a first application, we combine these data with a novel measure of light curve variability amplitude, the intrinsic modulation index, through a likelihood analysis to examine the variability properties of subpopulations of our sample. We demonstrate that, with high significance (6$\sigma$), gamma-ray-loud blazars detected by the LAT during its first 11 months of operation vary with almost a factor of two greater amplitude than do the gamma-ray-quiet blazars in our sample. We also find a significant (3$\sigma$) difference between variability amplitude in BL Lacertae objects and flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), with the former exhibiting larger variability amplitudes. Finally, low-redshift (z {\textless} 1) FSRQs are found to vary more strongly than high-redshift FSRQs, with 3$\sigma$ significance. These findings represent an important step toward understanding why some blazars emit gamma-rays while others, with apparently similar properties, remain silent.},

We detected QS Vir, a low accretion-rate CV; V2400 Oph, a discless intermediate polar; and recovered the polar AM Her in the Very Large Array Sky Survey 2-4 GHz radio images. The radio luminosities of these systems are higher than typically expected from coronal emission from stars of similar spectral types, and neither system is expected to produce jets, leaving the origin of the radio emission a puzzle. The radio emission mechanism for these two CVs may be electron-cyclotron maser emission, synchrotron radiation, or a more exotic process. We compile published radio detections of CVs, and X-ray measurements of these CVs, to illustrate their locations in the radio-X-ray luminosity plane, a diagnostic tool often used for X-ray binaries, active galactic nuclei, and radio stars. Several radio-emitting CVs, including these two newly detected CVs, seem to lie near the principal radio/X-ray track followed by black hole X-ray binaries at low luminosity, suggesting additional complexity in classifying unknown systems using their radio and X-ray luminosities alone.},

	abstract = {QS Vir is a low-accretion rate cataclysmic variable (CV), or pre-CV, as the M dwarf companion is just filling its Roche lobe. We recently identified radio emission from QS Vir in the Very Large Array Sky Survey, at a flux of {\textasciitilde}1 mJy. The origin of radio emission from CVs is not fully understood, with evidence for synchrotron emission from jets and other coherent plasma emission processes, such as electron cyclotron maser emission (ECME) or plasma radiation. Our aim is to constrain the radio emission mechanism for QS Vir, through spectroscopic, polarisation, and time variability measurements, all while checking for correlated X-ray variations. We took 3 epochs of new observations with the VLA in S, C, and X bands, with full Stokes polarisation information, complemented by near-simultaneous Swift/XRT X-ray data. Radio spectra are extracted to search for emission features characteristic of coherent plasma emission processes (e.g. high circular polarisation and narrow-band emission). We fit the X-ray spectra with absorbed power-laws, finding no strong X-ray variability. QS Vir showed a nearly flat radio spectrum, with fluxes of 0.4-0.6 mJy in all bands. Swift/XRT showed L\_X {\textasciitilde} 5x10{\textasciicircum}29 erg/s in all observations. We identified strong, variable circular polarisation, ranging from 33+/-3\% in S band in the last observation, to {\textless}11\% in the middle observation in all bands. Linear polarisation was not detected, with upper limits of at most 15\%. Intriguingly, the S-band spectra show circularly polarised spectral bumps (width {\textasciitilde}0.5 GHz) that rise and decay within {\textless}5 minutes. We suggest that the radio emission from QS Vir consists of two components: a relatively constant, low-polarisation flat-spectrum component and a band-limited, rapidly variable, and strongly circularly polarised component. This latter coherent component may be associated with ECME or plasma radiation.},

The luminosity distances of these objects are determined by methods that employ relations between SN Ia luminosity and light curve shape. Combined with previous data from our High-z Supernova Search Team and recent results by Riess et al., this expanded set of 16 high-redshift supernovae and a set of 34 nearby supernovae are used to place constraints on the following cosmological parameters: the Hubble constant (H\_0), the mass density (Omega\_M), the cosmological constant (i.e., the vacuum energy density, Omega\_Lambda), the deceleration parameter (q\_0), and the dynamical age of the universe (t\_0). The distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia are, on average, 10\%-15\% farther than expected in a low mass density (Omega\_M = 0.2) universe without a cosmological constant. Different light curve fitting methods, SN Ia subsamples, and prior constraints unanimously favor eternally expanding models with positive cosmological constant (i.e., Omega\_Lambda {\textgreater} 0) and a current acceleration of the expansion (i.e., q\_0 {\textless} 0). With no prior constraint on mass density other than Omega\_M {\textgreater}= 0, the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia are statistically consistent with q\_0 {\textless} 0 at the 2.8 sigma and 3.9 sigma confidence levels, and with Omega\_Lambda {\textgreater} 0 at the 3.0 sigma and 4.0 sigma confidence levels, for two different fitting methods, respectively. Fixing a ``minimal'' mass density, Omega\_M = 0.2, results in the weakest detection, Omega\_Lambda {\textgreater} 0 at the 3.0 sigma confidence level from one of the two methods. For a flat universe prior (Omega\_M + Omega\_Lambda = 1), the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia require Omega\_Lambda {\textgreater} 0 at 7 sigma and 9 sigma formal statistical significance for the two different fitting methods. A universe closed by ordinary matter (i.e., Omega\_M = 1) is formally ruled out at the 7 sigma to 8 sigma confidence level for the two different fitting methods. We estimate the dynamical age of the universe to be 14.2 +/- 1.7 Gyr including systematic uncertainties in the current Cepheid distance scale. We estimate the likely effect of several sources of systematic error, including progenitor and metallicity evolution, extinction, sample selection bias, local perturbations in the expansion rate, gravitational lensing, and sample contamination. Presently, none of these effects appear to reconcile the data with Omega\_Lambda = 0 and q\_0 {\textgreater}= 0.},

	abstract = {Long Period radio Transients (LPTs) are a mysterious new class of radio transients pulsating on periods of minutes to hours. So far, eight LPTs have been discovered predominantly at low Galactic latitudes, yet their nature remains unknown. Here, I present the first phase-resolved optical spectroscopy of the 2.9-h LPT GLEAM-X J0704-37, acquired with the 10-m Keck I telescope. Radial velocity (RV) shifts of \$189{\textbackslash}pm 3 {\textbackslash}textrm\{km s\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ of an M5-type star in a binary system are detected on a period nearly equal to the radio period. Weak H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ emission is also present, with some of it possibly originating from outside of the M dwarf. Based on the RV amplitude, and assuming a typical M dwarf mass, the companion mass must be \$M {\textbackslash}geq 0.22 M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$. Calibrating the spectra with space-based {\textbackslash}textit\{Gaia\} photometry reveals that the system is nearly four times closer than previously reported, at \$d {\textbackslash}approx 400\$ pc, suggesting that more systems could be nearby and amenable to optical characterization. The optical spectrum between 3500-10,000 Angstrom is well modeled by a binary comprised of a massive white dwarf (WD; \$T\_{\textbackslash}textrm\{eff\}{\textbackslash}approx\$7,300 K, \$M{\textbackslash}approx0.8-1.0M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$) and M dwarf (\$T\_{\textbackslash}textrm\{eff\}{\textbackslash}approx\$3,000 K, \$M{\textbackslash}approx0.14M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$). Radio pulses arrive when the WD is at nearly maximum blueshift and the M dwarf at nearly maximum redshift, in contrast to what has been reported in a similar LPT, ILT J1101+5521. GLEAM-X J0704-37 is now the second LPT with an orbital period nearly equal to the radio period, hinting at two classes of LPTs: ``long LPTs'' (\$Prsim\$78 min) associated with WD + M dwarf binary orbits, and ``short LPTs'' (\$P{\textbackslash}lesssim\$78 min) related to WD or neutron star spins. This work demonstrates that precise localization of LPTs, which enables optical follow-up, will be key in uncovering the mechanism(s) that power this new class of phenomenon.},

	abstract = {In contrast to the converging, achromatic behaviour of axisymmetric gravitational lenses, diverging frequency-dependent lensing occurs from refraction due to a distribution of overdense axisymmetric plasma along an observer's line of sight. Such plasma lenses are particularly interesting from the point of view of astronomical observations because they can both magnify and dim the appearance of background sources as a function of frequency. Plasma lensing is believed to be involved in a number of separate phenomena involving the scintillation of radio pulsars, extreme scattering events of background radio sources, and may also play a role in the generation of fast radio bursts. These lensing phenomena are believed to occur in dense environments, in which there may be many density perturbations between an observer and background source. In this work we generalize individual plasma lens models to produce dual-component lenses using families of plasma lens models previously studied in the literature, namely the exponential and softened power-law lenses. Similar to binary gravitational lens models, these dual-component plasma lenses feature a rich and complex critical and caustic morphology, as well as generate more complicated light curves. We map the number of criticals formed for a given component separation and angular size, and highlight a relevant degeneracy between two particular models. This work provides an argument in favour of close monitoring of extreme scattering events in progress in order to break such model degeneracies.},

The broadband modeling also allows us to precisely define various other physical parameters and the minimum required amount of extinction to explain the absence of an optical afterglow. Our observations suggest a high extinction, at least 2.3 mag in the infrared (J) and at least 5.4 mag in the optical (U) in the host-galaxy rest frame.

	abstract = {In a study of, 36 extragalactic radio sources observed over 7 years with the Green Bank interferometer at 2.7 GHz and 8.1 GHz, Fiedler et al.1 have detected unusual variations in the light curves of several sources. The most dramatic event, found in the flux record of the quasar 0954 + 658, showed large modulations at both frequencies. At 8.1 GHz, there are four spikes over a period {\textasciitilde}80 days in each of which the intensity increases roughly threefold. At 2.7 CfHz, two broad maxima of width {\textasciitilde}30 days bracket the high-frequency event, with a total duration of {\textasciitilde}120 days. At least two other sources show similar 2.7-GHz variations. Fiedler et al. argue cogently that these variations are unlikely to be intrinsic to the sources and that refractive scintillation in the interstellar medium is probably responsible. They postulate the existence of large-scale (1013-1014 cm) localized plasma density inhomo-geneities in the interstellar medium (ISM) to explain these observations. Independent evidence for strong local fluctuations in the ISM electron density on these scales comes froin the unusually large amplitude of low-frequency quasar variation2, the presence of periodicities in pulsar dynamic scintillation spectra3 and non-gaussian spikes in pulsar light curves4. All three phenomena have been interpreted as multiple imaging and focusing by large-scale refractors. Here we present a more detailed interpretation of the event in 0954 + 658, propose possible sites for the refracting clouds and suggest some future observations.},

	abstract = {For about half a century, the radio pulsar population was observed to spin in the {\textasciitilde}0.002-12 s range, with different pulsar classes having a spin-period evolution that differs substantially depending on their magnetic fields or past accretion history. The recent detection of several slowly rotating pulsars has reopened the long-standing question of the exact physics, and observational biases, driving the upper bound of the period range of the pulsar population. In this work, we perform a parameter study of the spin-period evolution of pulsars interacting with supernova fallback matter and specifically look at the fallback accretion disk scenario. Depending on the initial conditions at formation, this evolution can differ substantially from the typical dipolar spin-down, resulting in pulsars that show spin periods longer than their coeval peers. By using general assumptions for the pulsar spin period and magnetic field at birth, initial fallback accretion rates, and including magnetic field decay, we find that very long spin periods (?100 s) can be reached in the presence of strong, magnetar-like magnetic fields (?1014 G) and moderate initial fallback accretion rates ({\textasciitilde}1022-1027 g s-1). In addition, we study the cases of two recently discovered periodic radio sources, the pulsar PSR J0901-4046 (P = 75.9 s) and the radio transient GLEAM-X J162759.5-523504.3 (P = 1091 s), in light of our model. We conclude that the supernova fallback scenario could represent a viable channel to produce a population of long-period isolated pulsars that only recent observation campaigns are starting to unveil.},

Our results focus on eight cases that show potential late-time radio emission. These supernovae exhibit significantly greater amounts of radio emission than expected from the standard model of a single shockwave propagating through a spherical circumstellar medium, with a constant density structure produced by regular stellar mass-loss. We also discuss how we can learn from future ASKAP surveys about the circumstellar environments and emission mechanisms of supernovae that undergo late-time radio re-brightening.

We detected this high-proper-motion ultracool dwarf with the Australian SKA Pathfinder in 1.36 GHz imaging data from the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey. We observed WISE J062309.94-045624.6 to have a time and frequency averaged Stokes I flux density of 4.17 {\textpm} 0.41 mJy beam-1, with an absolute circular polarization fraction of 66.3\% {\textpm} 9.0\%, and calculated a specific radio luminosity of L $\nu$ {\textasciitilde} 1014.8 erg s-1 Hz-1. In follow-up observations with the Australian Telescope Compact Array and MeerKAT we identified a multipeaked pulse structure, used dynamic spectra to place a lower limit of B {\textgreater} 0.71 kG on the dwarf's magnetic field, and measured a P = 1.912 {\textpm} 0.005 hr periodicity, which we concluded to be due to rotational modulation. The luminosity and period we measured are comparable to those of other ultracool dwarfs observed at radio wavelengths. This implies that future megahertz to gigahertz surveys, with increased cadence and improved sensitivity, are likely to detect similar or later-type dwarfs. Our detection of WISE J062309.94-045624.6 makes this dwarf the coolest and latest-type star observed to produce radio emission.},

We have also attempted to detect flaring radio emission from the HR 8799 planetary system, guided by theoretical work indicating that hot, massive exoplanets may have strong magnetic fields capable of generating radio emission at GHz frequencies. We have detected and confirmed radio flares from the T6.5 dwarf 2MASS J10475385+2124234. This detection dramatically extends the temperature range over which brown dwarfs appear to be at least sporadic radio-emitters, from 1900 K (L3.5) down to 900 K (T6.5). It also demonstrates that the utility of radio detection as a unique tool to study the magnetic fields of substellar objects extends to the coolest dwarfs, and, plausibly to hot, massive exoplanets. We have also identified a single, 3.6$\sigma$ flare from the L1 dwarf, 2MASS J1439284+192915. This detection is tentative and requires confirmation by additional monitoring observations.},

Here I present \~{}4.75 GHz Arecibo radio telescope observations of HD 189733 during a fraction of the exoplanet orbital phase range previously associated with enhanced coronal X-ray flaring. No radio flares from the lower corona were detected. I also leverage Microvariability and Oscillations of Stars, Automated Photoelectric Telescope, and Wise photometry to measure the occurrences of minima associated with enhanced starspot activity. The phasing of these minima with the exoplanet orbit does not reveal any synchronized active region behavior. Moreover, for the first time, I combine X-ray, ultraviolet, photometric, Ca II H and K, H$\alpha$, and radio observations of HD 189733 to conduct an extensive, holistic reexamination of stellar activity in this system. Through the presentation of new data, and by merging physical and statistical analytic approaches, I demonstrate that the previously asserted enhancements in activity, allegedly synchronized to certain exoplanet orbital phases, are likely the result of inadequately sampled intrinsic stellar activity from an active star, rather than star-planet interactions.},

Automated pipelines to process the information stored in the images are being developed, such as the LOFAR Transients Pipeline, outputting light curves and various transient parameters. These pipelines have a number of tuneable parameters that require training to meet the survey requirements. This paper utilises both observed and simulated datasets to demonstrate different machine learning strategies that can be used to train these parameters. We use a simple anomaly detection algorithm and a penalised logistic regression algorithm. The datasets used are from LOFAR observations and we process the data using the LOFAR Transients Pipeline; however the strategies developed are applicable to any light curve datasets at different frequencies and can be adapted to different automated pipelines. These machine learning strategies are publicly available as PYTHON tools that can be downloaded and adapted to different datasets (https://github.com/AntoniaR/TraP\_ML\_tools).},

We argue that the observed radio emission was produced by synchrotron emission from a transient radio jet. Comparing the radio light curves from previous and subsequent outbursts of this system (including high-resolution observations from outbursts in 2011 and 2012) shows that the typical long and short outbursts of this system exhibit reproducible radio outbursts that do not vary significantly between outbursts, which is consistent with the similarity of the observed optical, ultraviolet and X-ray light curves. Contemporaneous optical and X-ray observations show that the radio emission appears to have been triggered at the same time as the initial X-ray flare, which occurs as disc material first reaches the boundary layer. This raises the possibility that the boundary region may be involved in jet production in accreting white dwarf systems. Our high spatial resolution monitoring shows that the compact jet remained active throughout the outburst with no radio quenching.},

We present a characterization of the afterglows arising from structured jets, providing a framework covering both successful and choked jets. We compute new closure relations for decelerating structured jets and compare them with the established relations for energy injection and refreshed shock models. The temporal slope before the jet break is found to be a simple function of the ratio between the viewing angle and effective opening angle of the jet. A numerical model to calculate synthetic light curves and spectra is publicly available as the open-source Python package afterglowpy.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a study of the local radio source population, by cross-comparing the data from the first data release (DR1) of the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR7 main galaxy spectroscopic sample. The LoTSS DR1 provides deep data (median rms noise of 71 $\mu$Jy at 150 MHz) over 424 square degrees of sky, which is sufficient to detect 10 615 (32 per cent) of the SDSS galaxies over this sky area. An improved method to separate active galactic nuclei (AGN) accurately from sources with radio emission powered by star formation (SF) is developed and applied, leading to a sample of 2121 local (z {\textless} 0.3) radio AGN. The local 150 MHz luminosity function is derived for radio AGN and SF galaxies separately, and the good agreement with previous studies at 1.4 GHz suggests that the separation method presented is robust. The prevalence of radio AGN activity is confirmed to show a strong dependence on both stellar and black hole masses, remarkably reaching a fraction of 100 per cent of the most massive galaxies ({\textgreater} 1011 M?) displaying radio-AGN activity with L150 MHz >= 1021 W Hz-1; thus, the most massive galaxies are always switched on at some level. The results allow the full Eddington-scaled accretion rate distribution (a proxy for the duty cycle) to be probed for massive galaxies, and this accretion rate is found to peak at Lmech/LEdd ? 10-5. More than 50 per cent of the energy is released during the <=2 per cent of the time spent at the highest accretion rates, Lmech/LEdd {\textgreater} 10-2.5. Stellar mass is shown to be a more important driver of radio-AGN activity than black hole mass, suggesting a possible connection between the fuelling gas and the surrounding halo. This result is in line with models in which these radio AGN are essential for maintaining the quenched state of galaxies at the centres of hot gas haloes.},

	abstract = {Around 10 per cent of bright low-frequency radio sources observed with the Murchison Wide-field Array (MWA) show strong interplanetary scintillation (IPS) on time-scales of a few seconds, implying that almost all their low-frequency radio emission comes from a compact component less than 0.5 arcsec in angular size. Most of these objects are compact steep-spectrum or MHz-peaked spectrum radio sources. We have used mid-infrared data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) catalogue to search for the host galaxies of 65 strongly scintillating MWA sources and compare their properties with those of the overall population of bright low-frequency radio sources. We identified WISE mid-infrared counterparts for 91 per cent of the bright sources in a single 900 deg2 MWA field, and found that the hosts of the strongly scintillating sources were typically at least 1 mag fainter in the WISE W1 (3.4 \{$\mu$\}m) band than the hosts of weakly scintillating MWA sources of similar radio flux density. This difference arises mainly because the strongly scintillating sources are more distant. We estimate that strongly scintillating MWA sources have a median redshift of z \~{} 1.5, and that at least 30 per cent of them are likely to lie at z {\textgreater} 2. The recently developed wide-field IPS technique therefore has the potential to provide a powerful new tool for identifying high-redshift radio galaxies without the need for radio spectral-index selection.},

	abstract = {We present some first results on the variability, polarization and general properties of radio sources selected at 20GHz, the highest frequency at which a sensitive radio survey has been carried out over a large area of sky. Sources with flux densities above 100mJy in the Australia Telescope Compact Array 20GHz pilot survey at declination -60{\textdegree} to -70{\textdegree} were observed at up to three epochs during 2002-04, including near-simultaneous measurements at 5, 8 and 18GHz in 2003. Of the 173 sources detected, 65 per cent are candidate QSOs or BL Lac objects, 20 per cent galaxies and 15 per cent faint (bJ {\textgreater} 22mag) optical objects or blank fields. On a 1-2yr time-scale, the general level of variability at 20GHz appears to be low. For the 108 sources with good-quality measurements in both 2003 and 2004, the median variability index at 20GHz was 6.9 per cent and only five sources varied by more than 30 per cent in flux density. Most sources in our sample show low levels of linear polarization (typically 1-5 per cent), with a median fractional polarization of 2.3 per cent at 20GHz. There is a trend for fainter 20GHz sources to have higher fractional polarization. At least 40 per cent of sources selected at 20GHz have strong spectral curvature over the frequency range 1-20GHz. We use a radio `two-colour diagram' to characterize the radio spectra of our sample, and confirm that the flux densities of radio sources at 20GHz (which are also the foreground point-source population for cosmic microwave background anisotropy experiments like Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe and Planck) cannot be reliably predicted by extrapolating from surveys at lower frequencies. As a result, direct selection at 20GHz appears to be a more efficient way of identifying 90GHz phase calibrators for Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) than the currently proposed technique of extrapolation from radio surveys at 1-5GHz.},

	abstract = {Although it is well established that some extragalactic radio sources are time-variable, the properties of this radio variability, and its connection with host galaxy properties, remain to be explored-particularly for faint sources. Here we present an analysis of radio variable sources from the CHILES Variable and Explosive Radio Dynamic Evolution Survey (CHILES VERDES)-a partner project of the 1.4 GHz COSMOS H I Large Extragalactic Survey. CHILES VERDES provides an unprecedented combination of survey depth, duration, and cadence, with 960 hr of 1-2 GHz continuum VLA data obtained over 209 epochs between 2013 and 2019 in a 0.44 deg2 section of the well-studied extragalactic deep field, COSMOS. We identified 18 moderate-variability sources (showing 10\%-30\% flux density variation) and 40 lower-variability sources (2\%-10\% flux density variation). They are mainly active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with radio luminosities in the range of 1022-1027 W Hz-1, based on cross-matching with COSMOS multiwavelength catalogs. The moderate-variability sources span redshifts z = 0.22-1.56, have mostly flat radio spectra ($\alpha$ {\textgreater} -0.5), and vary on timescales ranging from days to years. The lower-variability sources have similar properties, but generally have higher radio luminosities than the moderate-variability sources, extending to z = 2.8, and have steeper radio spectra ($\alpha$ {\textless} -0.5). No star-forming galaxy showed statistically significant variability in our analysis. The observed variability likely originates from scintillation on short ({\textasciitilde}week) timescales, and Doppler-boosted intrinsic AGN variability on long (month-year) timescales.},

To compare theoretical models with afterglow observations, we calculate here the broadband spectrum and corresponding light curve of synchrotron radiation from a power-law distribution of electrons in an expanding relativistic shock. Both the spectrum and the light curve consist of several power-law segments with related indices. The light curve is constructed under two limiting models for the hydrodynamic evolution of the shock: fully adiabatic and fully radiative. We give explicit relations between the spectral index and the temporal power-law index.

This paper does not introduce a new detection technique, but instead studies the reliability and efficiency of detection with the most commonly used technique, the periodogram, in the case where the observation times are unevenly spaced. This choice was made because, of the methods in current use, it appears to have the simplest statistical behavior. A modification of the classical definition of the periodogram is necessary in order to retain the simple statistical behavior of the evenly spaced case. With this modification, periodogram analysis and least-squares fitting of sine waves to the data are exactly equivalent. Certain difficulties with the use of the periodogram are less important than commonly believed in the case of detection of strictly periodic signals. In addition, the standard method for mitigating these difficulties (tapering) can be used just as well if the sampling is uneven. An analysis of the statistical significance of signal detections is presented, with examples},

The DFT, which can be inverted to recover the original data and the sampling, is used to compute correlation functions by means of a procedure which is effectively, but not explicitly, an interpolation. The CCF can be computed for two time series not even sampled at the same set of times. Techniques for removing the distortion of the correlation functions caused by the sampling, determining the value of a constant component to the data, and treating unequally weighted data are also discussed.

We incorporate GRB 231117A into a larger sample of 132 X-ray detected events, 71 of which were radio-observed (17 cm-band detections), for a systematic study of the distributions of redshifts, jet and afterglow properties, galactocentric offsets, and local environments of events with and without detected radio afterglows. Compared to the entire short GRB population, the majority of radio-detected GRBs are at relatively low redshifts (z {\textless} 0.6) and have high circumburst densities ({\textgreater}10-2 cm-3), consistent with their smaller ({\textless}8 kpc) projected galactocentric offsets. We additionally find that 70\% of short GRBs with opening angle measurements were radio-detected, indicating the importance of radio afterglows in jet measurements, especially in the cases of wide ({\textgreater}10{\textdegree}) jets where observational evidence of collimation may only be detectable at radio wavelengths.

	abstract = {Context. Mass loss from massive stars, especially towards the end of their lives, plays a key role in their evolution. Radio emission from core-collapse supernovae (SNe) serves as a probe of the interaction of the SN ejecta with the circumstellar medium (CSM) and can reveal the mass-loss history of the progenitor. Aims: We aim to present broadband radio observations of the CSM-interacting SN 2019oys. SN 2019oys was first detected in the optical and was classified as a Type Ib SN. Then, {\textasciitilde}100 days after discovery, it showed an optical rebrightening and a spectral transition to a spectrum dominated by strong narrow emission lines, which suggests strong interaction with a distant, dense, CSM shell. Methods: We modelled the broadband, multi-epoch radio spectra, covering 2.2 to 36 GHz and spanning from 22 to 1425 days after optical discovery, as a synchrotron emitting source. Using this modelling, we characterised the shockwave and the mass-loss rate of the progenitor. Results: Our broadband radio observations show strong synchrotron emission. This emission, as observed 201 and 221 days after optical discovery, exhibits signs of free-free absorption from the material in front of the shock travelling in the CSM. In addition, the steep power law of the optically thin regime points towards synchrotron cooling of the radiating electrons. Analysing these spectra in the context of the SN-CSM interaction model gives a shock velocity of 11 000 km s-1 (for a radius evolution of {\textasciitilde}?t0.8, where ?t is the time since optical discovery) and an electron number density of 4.1 {\texttimes} 105 cm-3 at a distance of 2.6 {\texttimes} 1016 cm. This translates to a high mass-loss rate from the progenitor massive star of 10-3 M? yr-1 for an assumed wind of 100 km s-1 (assuming a constant mass-loss rate in steady winds). The late-time radio spectra, 392 and 557 days after optical discovery, show broad spectral peaks. We show that this can be explained by introducing a non-homogeneous CSM structure.

This sample comprises both archival data and our new observations of 99 CCSNe conducted with the AMI-LA radio array in a systematic approach devised to constrain the mass loss at different stages of stellar evolution. In the supernova (SN){\textendash}CSM interaction model, observing the peak of the radio emission of an SN provides the CSM density at a given radius (and therefore the mass-loss rate that deposited this CSM). On the other hand, limits on the radio emission, and/or on the peak of the radio emission provide a region in the CSM phase space that can be ruled out. Our analysis shows a discrepancy between the values of mass-loss rates derived from radio-detected and radio-nondetected SNe. Furthermore, we rule out mass-loss rates in the range of 2 {\texttimes} 10-6{\textendash}10-4 M? yr-1 for different epochs during the last 1000 yr before the explosion (assuming wind velocity of 10 km s-1) for the progenitors of {\textasciitilde}80\% of the Type II supernovae (SNe II) in our sample. In addition, we rule out the ranges of mass-loss rates suggested for red supergiants for {\textasciitilde}50\% of the progenitors of SNe II in our sample.

We detected no radio emission from 30-220 d after the optical discovery in our observations at 15.5 GHz down to a 3$\sigma$ level of {\textless}0.14 mJy. The fast-rising, delayed radio flare is observed in our radio data set and continues to rise almost {\textasciitilde}1580 d after the optical discovery.

In the context of this model, we require a powerful narrow jet with an isotropic equivalent kinetic energy Ek, iso {\textasciitilde} 1055 erg, an opening angle of {\textasciitilde}7{\textdegree}, and a relatively large viewing angle of {\textasciitilde}42{\textdegree}, launched at the time of the stellar disruption. Within our framework, we find that the minimal collimated energy possible for an off-axis jet from AT 2018hyz is Ek >= 3 {\texttimes} 1052 erg. Finally, we provide predictions based on our model for the light curve turnover time, and for the proper motion of the radio emitting source.},

	abstract = {A subset of Type Ic supernovae (SNe Ic), broad-lined SNe Ic (SNe Ic-bl), show unusually high kinetic energies ({\textasciitilde}1052 erg) that cannot be explained by the energy supplied by neutrinos alone. Many SNe Ic-bl have been observed in coincidence with long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) that suggests a connection between SNe and GRBs. A small fraction of core-collapse supernovae form a rapidly rotating and strongly magnetized protoneutron star (PNS), a proto-magnetar. Jets from such magnetars can provide the high kinetic energies observed in SNe Ic-bl and also provide the connection to GRBs. In this work, we use the jetted outflow produced in a 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic CCSN simulation from a consistently formed proto-magnetar as the central engine for full-star explosion simulations. We extract a range of central engine parameters and find that the extracted engine energy is in the range of 6.231 {\texttimes} 1051-1.725 {\texttimes} 1052 erg, the engine time-scale in the range of 0.479-1.159 s and the engine half-opening angle in the range of {\textasciitilde}9{\textdegree}-19{\textdegree}. Using these as central engines, we perform 2D special relativistic (SR) hydrodynamic (HD) and radiation transfer simulations to calculate the corresponding light curves and spectra. We find that these central engine parameters successfully produce SNe Ic-bl that demonstrates that jets from proto-magnetars can be viable engines for SNe Ic-bl. We also find that only the central engines with smaller opening angles ({\textasciitilde}11{\textdegree}) form a GRB implying that GRB formation is likely associated with narrower jet outflows and Ic-bl's without GRBs may be associated with wider outflows.},

	abstract = {Owing to their utility for measurements of cosmic acceleration, Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are perhaps the best-studied class of SNe, yet the progenitor systems of these explosions largely remain a mystery. A rare subclass of SNe Ia shows evidence of strong interaction with their circumstellar medium (CSM), and in particular, a hydrogen-rich CSM; we refer to them as SNe Ia-CSM. In the first systematic search for such systems, we have identified 16 SNe Ia-CSM, and here we present new spectra of 13 of them. Six SNe Ia-CSM have been well studied previously, three were previously known but are analyzed in depth for the first time here, and seven are new discoveries from the Palomar Transient Factory. The spectra of all SNe Ia-CSM are dominated by H$\alpha$ emission (with widths of {\textasciitilde}2000 km s-1) and exhibit large H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ intensity ratios (perhaps due to collisional excitation of hydrogen via the SN ejecta overtaking slower-moving CSM shells); moreover, they have an almost complete lack of He I emission. They also show possible evidence of dust formation through a decrease in the red wing of H$\alpha$ 75-100 days past maximum brightness, and nearly all SNe Ia-CSM exhibit strong Na I D absorption from the host galaxy. The absolute magnitudes (uncorrected for host-galaxy extinction) of SNe Ia-CSM are found to be -21.3 mag {\textless}= MR {\textless}= -19 mag, and they also seem to show ultraviolet emission at early times and strong infrared emission at late times (but no detected radio or X-ray emission). Finally, the host galaxies of SNe Ia-CSM are all late-type spirals similar to the Milky Way, or dwarf irregulars like the Large Magellanic Cloud, which implies that these objects come from a relatively young stellar population. This work represents the most detailed analysis of the SN Ia-CSM class to date.},

The wide field-of-view and high instantaneous sensitivity of instruments such as MeerKAT provides an opportunity to probe this class of sources, using image-plane detection techniques.

We deploy a prototype blind transient and variable search pipeline named Transient Radio Observations for Newbies. This processes calibrated visibility data, constructs high-time cadence images, performs a search for variability on multiple time-scales, and extracts light curves for detected sources. As proof of concept, we apply it to three MeerKAT observations of globular clusters, known to host transient or variable sources. We detect a previously known eclipsing MSP suspected to be a 'black widow' system, in the globular cluster Omega Centauri, with a light curve confirming the eclipsing nature of the emission. We detect a previously known 'red back' eclipsing MSP in the globular cluster Terzan 5. Using observations of the globular cluster 47 Tucanae, we detect two known millisecond pulsars (MSPs), and one previously reported MSP candidate, with hints of eclipsing behaviour.},

	abstract = {Our understanding of massive star evolution is in flux due to recent upheavals in our view of mass loss and observations of a high binary fraction among O-type stars. Mass-loss rates for standard metallicity-dependent winds of hot stars are lower by a factor of 2-3 compared with rates adopted in modern stellar evolution codes, due to the influence of clumping on observed diagnostics. Weaker hot star winds shift the burden of H-envelope removal to the winds, pulsations, and eruptions of evolved supergiants, as well as binary mass transfer. Studies of stripped-envelope supernovae, in particular, require binary mass transfer. Dramatic examples of eruptive mass loss are seen in Type IIn supernovae, which have massive shells ejected just a few years earlier. These eruptions are a prelude to core collapse, and may signify severe instabilities in the latest nuclear burning phases. We encounter the predicament that the most important modes of mass loss are also the most uncertain, undermining the predictive power of single-star evolution models. Moreover, the influence of winds and rotation has been evaluated by testing single-star models against observed statistics that, it turns out, are heavily influenced by binary evolution. Altogether, this may alter our view about the most basic outcomes of massive-star mass loss{\textemdash}are Wolf-Rayet stars and Type Ibc supernovae the products of winds, or are they mostly the result of binary evolution and eruptive mass loss? This is not fully settled, but mounting evidence points toward the latter. This paradigm shift impacts other areas of astronomy, because it changes predictions for ionizing radiation and wind feedback from stellar populations, it may alter conclusions about star-formation rates and initial mass functions, it affects the origin of compact stellar remnants, and it influences how we use supernovae as probes of stellar evolution across cosmic time.},

	abstract = {We study the composition of the faint radio population selected from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array Cosmic Evolution Survey (VLA-COSMOS) 3 GHz Large Project, which is a radio continuum survey performed at 10 cm wavelength. The survey covers a 2.6 square degree area with a mean rms of 2.3 $\mu$Jy/beam, cataloging 10 830 sources above 5$\sigma$, and enclosing the full 2 square degree COSMOS field. By combining these radio data with optical, near-infrared (UltraVISTA), and mid-infrared (Spitzer/IRAC) data, as well as X-ray data (Chandra), we find counterparts to radio sources for 93\% of the total radio sample reaching out to z ? 6; these sources are found in the unmasked areas of the COSMOS field, I.e., those not affected by saturated or bright sources in the optical to near-infrared (NIR) bands. We further classify the sources as star-forming galaxies or AGN based on various criteria, such as X-ray luminosity; observed mid-infrared color; UV-far-infrared spectral energy distribution; rest-frame, near-UV optical color that is corrected for dust extinction; and radio excess relative to that expected from the star formation rate of the hosts. We separate the AGN into subsamples dominated by low-to-moderate and moderate-to-high radiative luminosity AGN, I.e., candidates for high-redshift analogs to local low- and high-excitation emission line AGN, respectively. We study the fractional contributions of these subpopulations down to radio flux levels of 11 $\mu$Jy at 3 GHz (or 20 $\mu$Jy at 1.4 GHz assuming a spectral index of -0.7). We find that the dominant fraction at 1.4 GHz flux densities above 200 $\mu$Jy is constituted of low-to-moderate radiative luminosity AGN. Below densities of 100 $\mu$Jy the fraction of star-forming galaxies increases to 60\%, followed by the moderate-to-high radiative luminosity AGN ( 20\%) and low-to-moderate radiative luminosity AGN ( 20\%). Based on this observational evidence, we extrapolate the fractions down to sensitivities of the Square Kilometer Array (SKA). Our estimates suggest that at the faint flux limits to be reached by the (Wide, Deep, and UltraDeep) SKA1 surveys, a selection based only on radio flux limits can provide a simple tool to efficiently identify samples highly ({\textgreater}75\%) dominated by star-forming galaxies.

In this scenario, strong radio emission is predicted from the jet on a timescale 1-10 yr after the explosion as it decelerates and spreads into our line of sight. To test this hypothesis, we have carried out late-time radio observations of SN 1998bw at t=5.6 yr, yielding upper limits that are consistent with the continued fading of the supernova. We find these limits to be consistent with an off-axis jet only if the progenitor mass-loss rate is M{\textless}{\textasciitilde}4{\texttimes}10-7 Msolar yr-1 (for a wind velocity vw=1000 km s-1) or the fraction of the shock energy in magnetic fields is ?B{\textless}{\textasciitilde}10-3.

None of these objects exhibit radio emission attributable to off-axis gamma-ray burst jets spreading into our line of sight. Comparison with our afterglow models reveals the following conclusions. (1) Less than {\textasciitilde}10\% of Type Ibc supernovae are associated with typical gamma-ray bursts initially directed away from our line of sight; this places an empirical constraint on the GRB beaming factor of -1b{\textgreater}{\textless}{\textasciitilde}104, corresponding to an average jet opening angle, $\theta$j{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}0.8d. (2) This holds in particular for the broad-lined supernovae (SNe 1997dq, 1997ef, 1998ey, 2002ap, 2002bl, and 2003jd), which have been argued to host GRB jets. Our observations reveal no evidence for typical (or even subenergetic) GRBs and rule out the scenario in which every broad-lined SN harbors a GRB at the 84\% confidence level. Their large photospheric velocities and asymmetric ejecta (inferred from spectropolarimetry and nebular spectroscopy) appear to be characteristic of the nonrelativistic SN explosion and do not necessarily imply the existence of associated GRB jets.},

	abstract = {We present extensive radio observations of SN 2003L, the most luminous and energetic Type Ibc radio supernova with the exception of SN 1998bw (associated with GRB 980425). Observations from the Very Large Array are well described by fitting a synchrotron self-absorption model to the emission spectrum. This model implies a subrelativistic ejecta velocity, v{\textasciitilde}0.2c, and a size of r{\textasciitilde}4.3{\texttimes}1015 cm at t{\textasciitilde}10 days. The circumstellar density is suitably fitted with a stellar wind profile, ne{\textasciitilde}r-2cm-3 and a constant mass-loss rate of M?{\textasciitilde}7.5{\texttimes}10-6Msolaryr-1. Moreover, the magnetic field follows B{\textasciitilde}r-1 and the kinetic energy of the radio-bright ejecta is roughly E{\textasciitilde}1048 ergs assuming equipartition of energy between relativistic electrons and magnetic fields. Furthermore, we show that free-free absorption does not contribute significantly to the radio spectrum, since it implies ejecta velocities that are inconsistent with size constraints derived from Very Long Baseline Array observations. In conclusion, we find that although SN 2003L has a radio luminosity comparable to that seen in SN 1998bw, it shows no evidence for a significant amount of energy coupled to relativistic ejecta. Using SN 2003L as an example, we comment briefly on the coupling of ejecta velocity and energy in Type Ibc supernovae.},

At z=0.251, XRF 020903 is one of the nearest cosmic explosions ever detected, second only to the recent GRB 030329 and the unusual GRB 980425/SN 1998bw. Moreover, XRF 020903 is the first X-ray flash for which we detect an optical afterglow. The luminosity of the radio afterglow of XRF 020903 is 1000 times greater than that of Ibc supernovae but similar to those of GRB afterglows. From broadband afterglow modeling we show that the explosion energy of XRF 020903 is not dissimilar to values inferred for typical gamma-ray bursts, suggesting that these cosmological explosions may derive from a similar mechanism.},

	abstract = {Over the past decade, long-duration $\gamma$-ray bursts (GRBs)-including the subclass of X-ray flashes (XRFs)-have been revealed to be a rare variety of type Ibc supernova. Although all these events result from the death of massive stars, the electromagnetic luminosities of GRBs and XRFs exceed those of ordinary type Ibc supernovae by many orders of magnitude. The essential physical process that causes a dying star to produce a GRB or XRF, and not just a supernova, is still unknown. Here we report radio and X-ray observations of XRF 060218 (associated with supernova SN 2006aj), the second-nearest GRB identified until now. We show that this event is a hundred times less energetic but ten times more common than cosmological GRBs. Moreover, it is distinguished from ordinary type Ibc supernovae by the presence of 1048erg coupled to mildly relativistic ejecta, along with a central engine (an accretion-fed, rapidly rotating compact source) that produces X-rays for weeks after the explosion. This suggests that the production of relativistic ejecta is the key physical distinction between GRBs or XRFs and ordinary supernovae, while the nature of the central engine (black hole or magnetar) may distinguish typical bursts from low-luminosity, spherical events like XRF 060218.},

	abstract = {Long duration $\gamma$-ray bursts (GRBs) mark the explosive death of some massive stars and are a rare sub-class of type Ibc supernovae. They are distinguished by the production of an energetic and collimated relativistic outflow powered by a central engine (an accreting black hole or neutron star). Observationally, this outflow is manifested in the pulse of $\gamma$-rays and a long-lived radio afterglow. Until now, central-engine-driven supernovae have been discovered exclusively through their $\gamma$-ray emission, yet it is expected that a larger population goes undetected because of limited satellite sensitivity or beaming of the collimated emission away from our line of sight. In this framework, the recovery of undetected GRBs may be possible through radio searches for type Ibc supernovae with relativistic outflows. Here we report the discovery of luminous radio emission from the seemingly ordinary type Ibc SN 2009bb, which requires a substantial relativistic outflow powered by a central engine. A comparison with our radio survey of type Ibc supernovae reveals that the fraction harbouring central engines is low, about one per cent, measured independently from, but consistent with, the inferred rate of nearby GRBs. Independently, a second mildly relativistic supernova has been reported.},

	abstract = {The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) will be the largest radio astronomy observatory ever built, providing unprecedented sensitivity over a very broad frequency band from 50 MHz to 15.3 GHz. The SKA's low frequency component (SKA-Low), which will observe in the 50-350 MHz band, will be built at the Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory (MRO) in Western Australia. It will consist of 512 stations each composed of 256 dual-polarised antennas, and the sensitivity of an individual station is pivotal to the performance of the entire SKA-Low telescope. The answer to the question in the title is, it depends. The sensitivity of a low frequency array, such as an SKA-Low station, depends strongly on the pointing direction of the digitally formed station beam and the local sidereal time (LST), and is different for the two orthogonal polarisations of the antennas. The accurate prediction of the SKA-Low sensitivity in an arbitrary direction in the sky is crucial for future observation planning. Here, we present a sensitivity calculator for the SKA-Low radio telescope, using a database of pre-computed sensitivity values for two realisations of an SKA-Low station architecture. One realisation uses the log-periodic antennas selected for SKA-Low. The second uses a known benchmark, in the form of the bowtie dipoles of the Murchison Widefield Array. Prototype stations of both types were deployed at the MRO in 2019, and since then have been collecting commissioning and verification data. These data were used to measure the sensitivity of the stations at several frequencies and over at least 24 h intervals, and were compared to the predictions described in this paper. The sensitivity values stored in the SQLITE database were pre-computed for the X, Y, and Stokes I polarisations in 10 MHz frequency steps, \${\textbackslash}scriptsize\{1/2\}\$ hour LST intervals, and \$5{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$ resolution in pointing directions. The database allows users to quickly and easily estimate the sensitivity of SKA-Low for arbitrary observing parameters (your favourite object) using interactive web-based or command line interfaces. The sensitivity can be calculated using publicly available web interface (http://sensitivity.skalow.link) or a command line python package (https://github.com/marcinsokolowski/station\_beam), which can also be used to calculate the sensitivity for arbitrary pointing directions, frequencies, and times without interpolations.},

Between NRAO Very Large Array (VLA) Sky Survey observations in 1993 to VLA Sky Survey observations in 2018, VT J0243 rose from a {\textasciitilde} GHz radio luminosity of $\nu$ L $\nu$ ? 1038 erg s-1 to $\nu$ L $\nu$ {\textasciitilde} 1040 erg s-1, and still continues to brighten.

The jet is energetic ({\textasciitilde}1051-52 erg), and had a radius {\textasciitilde}0.7 pc in 2021 December. X-ray observations suggest a persistent or evolving corona, possibly associated with an accretion disk, and IR and optical observations constrain any high-energy counterpart to be sub-Eddington. VT J0243 may be an example of a young, off-axis radio jet from a slowly evolving tidal disruption event. Other more mysterious triggers for the accretion enhancement and jet launching are possible. In either case, VT J0243 is a unique example of a nascent jet, highlighting the unknown connection between supermassive black holes, the properties of their accretion flows, and jet launching.},

While we still lack the statistics to do detailed population studies of radio-selected TDEs, we use these events to suggest trends in host galaxy and optical light curve properties that may correlate with the presence of radio emission, and hence can inform optically-selected TDE radio follow-up campaigns. We find that radio-selected TDEs tend to have faint and cool optical flares, as well as host galaxies with low SMBH masses. Our radio-selected TDEs also tend to have more energetic, larger radio emitting regions than radio-detected, optically-selected TDEs. We consider possible explanations for these trends, including by invoking super-Eddington accretion and enhanced circumnuclear media. Finally, we constrain the radio-emitting TDE rate to be \$rsim 10\$ Gpc\${\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$ yr\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$.},

This behaviour was confirmed also by the long-term Owens Valley Radio Observatory monitoring data at 15 GHz. The milliarcsecond-scale resolution provided by the VLBA observations allowed us to resolve the two images of the lensed blazar, which have a core-jet structure. No significant morphological variation is found by the analysis of the multi-epoch data, suggesting that the region responsible for the $\gamma$-ray variability is located in the core of the active galactic nuclei, which is opaque up to the highest observing frequency of 22 GHz.},

The highly super-Eddington accretion rates achieved during this brief phase ( \${\textbackslash}dot\{M\}rsim \{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{5\}\{{\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Edd\}\})\$ are accompanied by intense mass loss in disk winds, analogous to but even more extreme than ultraluminous X-ray (ULX) sources in the nearby universe. Also in analogy with the observed ULX, this expanding outflow will inflate an energetic "bubble" of plasma into the circumbinary medium. Embedded within this bubble is a nebula of relativistic electrons heated at the termination shock of the faster v ? 0.1c wind/jet from the inner accretion flow. We present a time-dependent, one-zone model for the synchrotron radio emission and other observable properties of such ULX "hypernebulae." If ULX jets are sources of repeating fast radio bursts (FRB), as recently proposed, such hypernebulae could generate persistent radio emission and contribute large and time-variable rotation measure to the bursts, consistent with those seen from FRB 20121102 and FRB 20190520B. ULX hypernebulae can be discovered independently of an FRB association in radio surveys, such as VLASS, as off-nuclear point sources whose fluxes can evolve significantly on timescales as short as years, possibly presaging energetic transients from common-envelope mergers.},

Methods: We present interferometric radio frequency imaging of AR Sco at 1.5, 5 and 9 GHz, analysing the total flux and polarization behaviour of this source at high time resolution (10, 3 and 3 s), across a full 3.6 h orbital period in each band. Results: We find strong modulation of the radio flux on the orbital period and the orbital sideband of the white dwarf's spin period (also known as the "beat" period). This indicates that, like the optical flux, the radio flux arises predominantly from on or near the inner surface of the M-dwarf companion star. The beat-phase pulsations of AR Sco decrease in strength with decreasing frequency. They are strongest at 9 GHz and at an orbital phase 0.5. Unlike the optical emission from this source, radio emission from AR Sco shows weak linear polarization but very strong circular polarization, reaching 30\% at an orbital phase 0.8. We infer the probable existence of a non-relativistic cyclotron emission component, which dominates at low radio frequencies. Given the required magnetic fields, this also likely arises from on or near the M-dwarf.

	abstract = {Cosmic neutrinos provide a unique window into the otherwise hidden mechanism of particle acceleration in astrophysical objects. The IceCube Collaboration recently reported the likely association of one high-energy neutrino with a flare from the relativistic jet of an active galaxy pointed towards the Earth. However a combined analysis of many similar active galaxies revealed no excess from the broader population, leaving the vast majority of the cosmic neutrino flux unexplained. Here we present the likely association of a radio-emitting tidal disruption event, AT2019dsg, with a second high-energy neutrino. AT2019dsg was identified as part of our systematic search for optical counterparts to high-energy neutrinos with the Zwicky Transient Facility. The probability of finding any coincident radio-emitting tidal disruption event by chance is 0.5\%, while the probability of finding one as bright in bolometric energy flux as AT2019dsg is 0.2\%. Our electromagnetic observations can be explained through a multizone model, with radio analysis revealing a central engine, embedded in a UV photosphere, that powers an extended synchrotron-emitting outflow. This provides an ideal site for petaelectronvolt neutrino production. Assuming that the association is genuine, our observations suggest that tidal disruption events with mildly relativistic outflows contribute to the cosmic neutrino flux.},

Our sample includes one long gamma-ray burst, SN 2017iuk/GRB 171205A, and 18 core-collapse SNe detected at ?1-60 yr after explosion. No thermonuclear explosion shows evidence for bright radio emission, and hydrogen-poor progenitors dominate the subsample of core-collapse events with spectroscopic classification at the time of explosion (79\%). We interpret these findings in the context of the expected radio emission from the forward shock interaction with the circumstellar medium (CSM). We conclude that these observations require a departure from the single wind-like density profile (i.e., $\rho$ CSM ? r -2) that is expected around massive stars and/or from a spherical Newtonian shock. Viable alternatives include the shock interaction with a detached, dense shell of CSM formed by a large effective progenitor mass-loss rate, \${\textbackslash}dot\{M\}{\textbackslash}sim \{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{-4\}{\textbackslash}mbox\{--\}\{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textbackslash},\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ {\.M}{\textasciitilde}10-4-10-1M? yr-1 (for an assumed wind velocity of 1000 km s-1); emission from an off-axis relativistic jet entering our line of sight; or the emergence of emission from a newly born pulsar-wind nebula. The relativistic SN 2012ap that is detected 5.7 and 8.5 yr after explosion with L $\nu$ {\textasciitilde} 1028 erg s-1 Hz-1 might constitute the first detections of an off-axis jet+cocoon system in a massive star. However, none of the VLASS SNe with archival data points are consistent with our model off-axis jet light curves. Future multiwavelength observations will distinguish among these scenarios.

The object was discovered through the detection of 97 bright radio pulses in only one out of 66 epochs of observations spanning almost three years. The bright pulses have allowed the source to be localized to a precision of 0.5 arcsec through radio imaging. We observed the source location with the Swift X-ray telescope but did not detect any significant X-ray emission. We did not identify any high-energy bursts or multifrequency counterparts for this object. The solitary epoch of detection hinders the calculation of the surface magnetic field strength, but the long period and the microstructure in the single-pulses resembles the emission of radio-loud magnetars. If this is indeed a magnetar, it is located at a relatively high Galactic latitude (2.9{\textdegree}), making it potentially one of the oldest and the most intermittent magnetars known in the Galaxy. The very short activity window of this object is unique and may point towards a yet undetected population of long period, highly transient radio emitting neutron stars.},

This object may therefore be the most magnetized neutron star observed to date. In this paper, a critical analysis of a magnetar interpretation for the source is provided. (i) A minimum polar magnetic field strength of \$B {\textbackslash}sim 5 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{15\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mbox\{G\}\$ appears to be necessary for the star to activate as a radio pulsar, based on conventional 'death valley' assumptions. (ii) Back-extrapolation from magnetic braking and Hall-plastic-Ohm decay suggests that a large angularize momentum reservoir was available at birth to support intense field amplification. (iii) The observational absence of X-rays constrains the star's field strength and age, as the competition between heating from field decay and Urca cooling implies a surface luminosity as a function of time. If the object is an isolated, young (\${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mbox\{kyr\}\$) magnetar with a present-day field strength of \$B rsim 10{\textasciicircum}\{16\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mbox\{G\}\$, the upper limit (\${\textbackslash}approx 10{\textasciicircum}\{30\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mbox\{erg s\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$) set on its thermal luminosity suggests it is cooling via a direct Urca mechanism.},

This is particularly true of LOFAR, a recently-commissioned, low-frequency radio interferometer, based in the Netherlands and with stations across Europe. The identification of and response to transients is one of LOFAR's key science goals. However, the large data volumes which LOFAR produces, combined with the scientific requirement for rapid response, make automation essential. To support this, we have developed the LOFAR Transients Pipeline, or TraP. The TraP ingests multi-frequency image data from LOFAR or other instruments and searches it for transients and variables, providing automatic alerts of significant detections and populating a lightcurve database for further analysis by astronomers. Here, we discuss the scientific goals of the TraP and how it has been designed to meet them. We describe its implementation, including both the algorithms adopted to maximize performance as well as the development methodology used to ensure it is robust and reliable, particularly in the presence of artefacts typical of radio astronomy imaging. Finally, we report on a series of tests of the pipeline carried out using simulated LOFAR observations with a known population of transients.},

	abstract = {We report a study of X-ray emission from the white dwarf/M-type star binary system AR Scorpii using archival data taken in 2016-2020. It has been known that the X-ray emission is dominated by optically thin thermal plasma emission and its flux level varies significantly over the orbital phase. The X-ray emission also contains a component that modulates with the beat frequency between the white dwarf's spin frequency and orbital frequency. In this new analysis, the 2020 data taken by NICER shows that the X-ray emission modulates with the spin frequency as well as with the beat frequency, indicating that part of the X-ray emission comes from the white dwarf's magnetosphere. It is found that the signal of the spin frequency appears only at a specific orbital phase, while the beat signal appears over the orbital phase. We interpret the X-ray emission modulating with the spin frequency and the beat frequency as a result of synchrotron emission from electrons with smaller and larger pitch angles, respectively. In the long-term evolution, the beat pulse profile averaged over the orbital phase changes from a single-peak structure in 2016/2018 to a double-peak structure in 2020. The observed X-ray flux levels measured in 2016/2017 are higher than those measured in 2018/2020. The plasma temperature and the amplitude of the orbital waveform might vary with time too. These results indicate that the X-ray emission from AR Scorpii evolves on a timescale of years. This long-term evolution would be explained by a superorbital modulation related to, for example, a precession of the white dwarf or a fluctuation of the system related to the activity of the companion star.},

Here we present the results of a VLBI campaign using the Very Long Baseline Array, Very Large Array, Green Bank, Effelsberg, Arecibo, and Westerbork telescopes that resolves the radio afterglow of GRB 030329 and constrains its rate of expansion. The size of the afterglow is found to be {\textasciitilde}0.07 mas (0.2 pc) 25 days after the burst and 0.17 mas (0.5 pc) 83 days after the burst, indicating an average velocity of 3c-5c. This expansion is consistent with expectations of the standard fireball model. We measure the projected proper motion of GRB 030329 in the sky to less than 0.3 mas in the 80 days following the burst. In observations taken 52 days after the burst, we detect an additional compact component at a distance from the main component of 0.28+/-0.05 mas (0.80 pc).

The source was monitored from 1 day after the burst to 1 month later at centimeter wavelengths (1.4, 4.9, 8.3, and 15 GHz; Very Large Array) and in the 3 mm band (90 GHz; Owen Valley Radio Observatory). Based on its variability, compactness, and spectrum, we identify VLA J070238.0+385044 as the afterglow from GRB 980329. We interpret the rapid flux density variations as interstellar scintillation, and we interpret the sharp turnover in the radio spectrum below 13 GHz as arising from synchrotron self-absorption. This suggests that the angular diameter of the fireball from GRB 980329 was on the order of a few microarcseconds in the first 2 weeks. The absence of a readily detectable afterglow in the optical, but clear detections in both the radio and infrared, can be understood as the result of extinction by dust. In this context, it is interesting to note that half of all well-localized gamma-ray bursts have no optical counterpart. Based on our study of GRB 980329, we suggest that the progenitors of a sizable fraction of gamma-ray bursts are associated with regions of moderate to high gas density.},

	abstract = {Multifrequency radio monitoring of Nova Vulpeculae 1984 No. 2 has revealed a unique radio light curve, exhibiting a strong outburst which precedes the appearance of normal radio emission from the principal ejecta of the nova by at least 100 days. The early emission is extremely optically-thick and has brightness temperature in excess of 100,000 K. A model is discussed in which the radiation is produced by a strong shock propagating outward through the principal ejecta of the nova, as a result of an interaction with a later, high velocity wind from the central source. It is shown that the general features of the radio light curve can be explained by the presence of a central wind with a mass loss rate of about 0.00001 solar masses/yr, lasting for a period of 200 to 300 days after the optical outburst. The first radio map of nova ejecta shortly after outburst is presented. Comparison of the angular expansion rate to the ejection velocity implies a distance of 3.6 kpc, and preliminary analysis of the main outburst emission indicates a mass and kinetic energy of the ejecta respectively of about 0.0008 solar masses and 8 x 10 to the 45th erg.},

	abstract = {The Kelvin-Helmholtz cooling epoch, lasting tens of seconds after the birth of a neutron star in a successful core-collapse supernova, is accompanied by a neutrino-driven wind. For magnetar-strength ({\textasciitilde}1015 G) large-scale surface magnetic fields, this outflow is magnetically dominated during the entire cooling epoch. Because the strong magnetic field forces the wind to corotate with the proto-neutron star, this outflow can significantly affect the neutron star's early angular momentum evolution, as in analogous models of stellar winds. If the rotational energy is large in comparison with the supernova energy and the spin-down timescale is short with respect to the time required for the supernova shock wave to traverse the stellar progenitor, the energy extracted may modify the supernova shock dynamics significantly. This effect is capable of producing hyperenergetic supernovae and, in some cases, provides conditions favorable for gamma-ray bursts. We estimate spin-down timescales for magnetized, rotating proto-neutron stars and construct steady state models of neutrino-magnetocentrifugally driven winds. We find that if magnetars are born rapidly rotating, with initial spin periods (P) of {\textasciitilde}1 ms, then of order 1051-1052 ergs of rotational energy can be extracted in {\textasciitilde}10 s. If magnetars are born slowly rotating (P{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}10 ms), they can spin down to periods of {\textasciitilde}1 s on the Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale.},

We try to understand both its radio emission and pulsation in the neutron star scenario as an alternative to the white dwarf model. We think that (1) from the radio emission point of view, GLEAM-X J1627 can be a radio-loud magnetar; (2) from the rotational evolution point of view, GLEAM-X J1627 is unlikely to be an isolated magnetar; (3) the 1091 s period is unlikely to be the precession period; (4) GLEAM-X J1627 may be a radio-loud magnetar spun down by a fallback disk; (5) the pulsar death line is modified due to the presence of a fallback disk or a twisted magnetic field. In both cases, a higher maximum acceleration potential can be obtained. This may explain why GLEAM-X J1627 is still radioactive with such a long pulsation period; and (6) general constraints on the neutron star magnetic field and initial disk mass are given analytically. Possible ways to discriminate between different modelings are also discussed.},

We detect SGR J1745-2900 up to 225 GHz, the highest radio frequency detection of pulsed emission from a neutron star to date. Strong single pulses are also observed from 4.85 up to 154 GHz. At the millimetre band we see significant flux density and spectral index variabilities on time scales of tens of minutes, plus variability between days at all frequencies. Additionally, SGR J1745-2900 was observed at a different epoch at frequencies $\nu$ = 296-472 GHz using the APEX 12-m radio telescope, with no detections. Over the period MJD 56859.83-56862.93 the fitted spectrum yields a spectral index of {\textless}$\alpha${\textgreater} = -0.4 {\textpm} 0.1 for a reference flux density 154{\textgreater} = 1.1 {\textpm} 0.2 mJy (with S$\nu$ ? $\nu$$\alpha$), a flat spectrum alike those of the other radio-loud magnetars.

	doi = {10.1007/s00159-006-0001-y},
	abstract = {The electron-cyclotron maser is a process that generates coherent radiation from plasma. In the last two decades, it has gained increasing attention as a dominant mechanism of producing high-power radiation in natural high-temperature magnetized plasmas. Originally proposed as a somewhat exotic idea and subsequently applied to include non-relativistic plasmas, the electron-cyclotron maser was considered as an alternative to turbulent though coherent wave-wave interaction which results in radio emission. However, when it was recognized that weak relativistic corrections had to be taken into account in the radiation process, the importance of the electron-cyclotron maser rose to the recognition it deserves. Here we review the theory and application of the electron-cyclotron maser to the directly accessible plasmas in our immediate terrestrial and planetary environments. In situ access to the radiating plasmas has turned out to be crucial in identifying the conditions under which the electron-cyclotron maser mechanism is working. Under extreme astrophysical conditions, radiation from plasmas may provide a major energy loss; however, for generating the powerful radiation in which the electron-cyclotron maser mechanism is capable, the plasma must be in a state where release of susceptible amounts of energy in the form of radiation is favorable. Such conditions are realized when the plasma is unable to digest the available free energy that is imposed from outside and stored in its particle distribution. The lack of dissipative processes is a common property of collisionless plasmas. When, in addition, the plasma density becomes so low that the amount of free energy per particle is large, direct emission becomes favorable. This can be expressed as negative absorption of the plasma which, like in conventional masers, leads to coherent emission even though no quantum correlations are involved. The physical basis of this formal analogy between a quantum maser and the electron-cyclotron maser is that in the electron-cyclotron maser the free-space radiation modes can be amplified directly. Several models have been proposed for such a process. The most famous one is the so-called loss-cone maser. However, as argued in this review, the loss-cone maser is rather inefficient. Available in situ measurements indicate that the loss-cone maser plays only a minor role. Instead, the main source for any strong electron-cyclotron maser is found in the presence of a magnetic-field-aligned electric potential drop which has several effects: (1) it dilutes the local plasma to such an extent that the plasma enters the regime in which the electron-cyclotron maser becomes effective; (2) it generates energetic relativistic electron beams and field-aligned currents; (3) it deforms, together with the magnetic mirror force, the electron distribution function, thereby mimicking a high energy level sufficiently far above the Maxwellian ground state of an equilibrium plasma; (4) it favors emission in the free-space RX mode in a direction roughly perpendicular to the ambient magnetic field; (5) this emission is the most intense, since it implies the coherent resonant contribution of a maximum number of electrons in the distribution function to the radiation (i.e., to the generation of negative absorption); (6) it generates a large number of electron holes via the two-stream instability, and ion holes via the current-driven ion-acoustic instability which manifest themselves as subtle fine structures moving across the radiation spectrum and being typical for the electron-cyclotron maser emission process. These fine structures can thus be taken as the ultimate identifier of the electron-cyclotron maser. The auroral kilometric radiation of Earth is taken here as the paradigm for other manifestations of intense radio emissions such as the radiation from other planets in the solar system, from exoplanets, the Sun and other astrophysical objects.},

Homogeneous and power-law shaped jets, as well as simple cocoon models are ruled out by the data, while both a Gaussian shaped jet and a cocoon with energy injection can describe the current data set for a reasonable range of physical parameters, consistent with the typical values derived from short GRB afterglows. We propose that these models can be unambiguously discriminated by future observations measuring the post-peak behaviour, with F$\nu$ ? t\~{}-1.0 for the cocoon and F$\nu$? t\~{}-2.5 for the jet model.},

It will demonstrated that the use of an existing power wave based framework for noise characterization of multiport amplifiers is sufficiently general to evaluate Trcv of phased arrays. The calculation of Trcv was done using a combination of measured noise parameters of the low-noise amplifier (LNA) and simulated S-parameters of the arrays. The calculated values were compared to measured results obtained via astronomical observation and both results are found to be in agreement. Such verification is lacking in current literature. It was shown that the receiver noise temperatures of both arrays are lower when compared to a single isolated element.

	abstract = {Pulsar-timing data sets have been analysed with great success using probabilistic treatments based on Gaussian distributions, with applications ranging from studies of neutron-star structure to tests of general relativity and searches for nanosecond gravitational waves. As for other applications of Gaussian distributions, outliers in timing measurements pose a significant challenge to statistical inference, since they can bias the estimation of timing and noise parameters, and affect reported parameter uncertainties. We describe and demonstrate a practical end-to-end approach to perform Bayesian inference of timing and noise parameters robustly in the presence of outliers, and to identify these probabilistically. The method is fully consistent (I.e. outlier-ness probabilities vary in tune with the posterior distributions of the timing and noise parameters), and it relies on the efficient sampling of the hierarchical form of the pulsar-timing likelihood. Such sampling has recently become possible with a 'no-U-turn' Hamiltonian sampler coupled to a highly customized reparametrization of the likelihood; this code is described elsewhere, but it is already available online. We recommend our method as a standard step in the preparation of pulsar-timing-array data sets: even if statistical inference is not affected, follow-up studies of outlier candidates can reveal unseen problems in radio observations and timing measurements; furthermore, confidence in the results of gravitational-wave searches will only benefit from stringent statistical evidence that data sets are clean and outlier-free.},

Aims: We determine the physical parameters of the blast wave and its surroundings, in particular the index of the electron energy distribution, the energy of the blast wave, and the density (structure) of the circumburst medium. We then compare our results with those from image size measurements. Methods: We observed the GRB 030329 radio afterglow with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope and the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope at frequencies from 325 MHz to 8.4 GHz, spanning a time range of 268-1128 days after the burst. We modeled all the available radio data and derived the physical parameters. Results: The index of the electron energy distribution is p = 2.1, the circumburst medium is homogeneous, and the transition to the non-relativistic phase happens at t\{NR\}\~{} 80 days. The energy of the blast wave and density of the surrounding medium are comparable to previous findings. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that the blast wave is roughly spherical at t\{NR\}, and they agree with the implications from the VLBI studies of image size evolution. It is not clear from the presented dataset whether we have seen emission from the counter jet or not. We predict that the Low Frequency Array will be able to observe the afterglow of GRB 030329 and many other radio afterglows, constraining the physics of the blast wave during its non-relativistic phase even further.},

	abstract = {LOFAR, the LOw-Frequency ARray, is a new-generation radio interferometer constructed in the north of the Netherlands and across europe. Utilizing a novel phased-array design, LOFAR covers the largely unexplored low-frequency range from 10-240 MHz and provides a number of unique observing capabilities. Spreading out from a core located near the village of Exloo in the northeast of the Netherlands, a total of 40 LOFAR stations are nearing completion. A further five stations have been deployed throughout Germany, and one station has been built in each of France, Sweden, and the UK. Digital beam-forming techniques make the LOFAR system agile and allow for rapid repointing of the telescope as well as the potential for multiple simultaneous observations. With its dense core array and long interferometric baselines, LOFAR achieves unparalleled sensitivity and angular resolution in the low-frequency radio regime. The LOFAR facilities are jointly operated by the International LOFAR Telescope (ILT) foundation, as an observatory open to the global astronomical community. LOFAR is one of the first radio observatories to feature automated processing pipelines to deliver fully calibrated science products to its user community. LOFAR's new capabilities, techniques and modus operandi make it an important pathfinder for the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). We give an overview of the LOFAR instrument, its major hardware and software components, and the core science objectives that have driven its design. In addition, we present a selection of new results from the commissioning phase of this new radio observatory.},

The flare of photons emitted during the accretion of the stellar debris is predicted to be observable, and candidates of such events have been observed at optical to X-ray frequencies. If a fraction of the accreted material is fed into a jet, tidal flares should be detectable at radio frequencies too, thus comprising a new class of rare radio transients. Using the well-established scaling between accretion power and jet luminosity and basic synchrotron theory, we construct an empirically rooted model to predict the jet luminosity for a time-dependent accretion rate. We apply this model to stellar tidal disruptions and predict the snapshot rate of these events. For a small angle between the observer and the jet, our model reproduces the observed radio flux of the tidal flare candidate GRB 110328A. We find that future radio surveys will be able to test whether the majority of tidal disruptions are accompanied by a jet.},

We present a detection of variable radio emission from a thermal TDF, which we interpret as originating from a newly launched jet. The multiwavelength properties of the source present a natural analogy with accretion-state changes of stellar mass black holes, which suggests that all TDFs could be accompanied by a jet. In the rest frame of the TDF, our radio observations are an order of magnitude more sensitive than nearly all previous upper limits, explaining how these jets, if common, could thus far have escaped detection.},

	abstract = {We review some practical aspects of measuring the amplitude of variability in `red noise' light curves typical of those from active galactic nuclei (AGN). The quantities commonly used to estimate the variability amplitude in AGN light curves, such as the fractional rms variability amplitude, Fvar, and excess variance, $\sigma$2XS, are examined. Their statistical properties, relationship to the power spectrum and uses for investigating the nature of the variability processes are discussed. We demonstrate that $\sigma$2XS (or similarly Fvar) shows large changes from one part of the light curve to the next, even when the variability is produced by a stationary process. This limits the usefulness of these estimators for quantifying differences in variability amplitude between different sources or from epoch to epoch in one source. Some examples of the expected scatter in the variance are tabulated for various typical power spectral shapes, based on Monte Carlo simulations. The excess variance can be useful for comparing the variability amplitudes of light curves in different energy bands from the same observation. Monte Carlo simulations are used to derive a description of the uncertainty in the amplitude expected between different energy bands (due to measurement errors). Finally, these estimators are used to demonstrate some variability properties of the bright Seyfert 1 galaxy Markarian 766. The source is found to show a strong, linear correlation between rms amplitude and flux, and to show significant spectral variability.},

Some of this potential has been realized over the past few decades, however the upcoming era of large sky surveys promises to bring this promise to full fruition. In this article, we review the theoretical framework of this field, describe the prominent current methods for parameter inference from quasar microlensing data across different observing modalities, and discuss the constraints so far derived on the geometry and physics of quasar inner structure. We also review the application of strong lensing and microlensing to constraining the granularity of the lens potential, i.e. the contribution of the baryonic and dark matter components, and the local mass distribution in the lens, i.e. the stellar mass function. Finally, we discuss the future of the field, including the new possibilities that will be opened by the next generation of large surveys and by new analysis methods now being developed.},

These events trace particle acceleration, powered by magnetic reconnection, shock fronts (such as those formed by coronal mass ejections (CMEs)), and magnetospheric currents, in some cases offering the only window into these processes in stellar atmospheres. We conducted a 58 hr ultra-wideband survey for coherent radio bursts on five active M dwarfs. We used the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array to observe simultaneously in three frequency bands covering a subset of 224-482 MHz and 1-6 GHz, achieving the widest fractional bandwidth to date for any observations of stellar radio bursts. We detected 22 bursts across 13 epochs, providing the first large sample of wideband dynamic spectra of stellar coherent radio bursts. The observed bursts have diverse morphology, with durations ranging from seconds to hours, but all share strong (40\%-100\%) circular polarization. No events resemble solar Type II bursts (often associated with CMEs), but we cannot rule out the occurrence of radio-quiet stellar CMEs. The hours-long bursts are all polarized in the sense of the x-mode of the star{\textquoteright}s large-scale magnetic field, suggesting that they are cyclotron maser emission from electrons accelerated in the large-scale field, analogous to auroral processes on ultracool dwarfs. The duty cycle of luminous coherent bursts peaks at 25\% at 1-1.4 GHz, declining at lower and higher frequencies, indicating source regions in the low corona. At these frequencies, active M dwarfs should be the most common galactic transient source.},

	abstract = {Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are massive star explosions that are too luminous to be powered by traditional energy sources, such as the radioactive decay of 56Ni. Instead, they may be powered by a central engine, such as a millisecond pulsar or magnetar, whose relativistic wind inflates a nebula of high-energy particles and radiation behind the expanding supernova ejecta. We present three-dimensional Monte Carlo radiative transfer calculations of SLSNe that follow the production of high-energy emission in the nebula and its subsequent thermalization into optical radiation within the surrounding ejecta and, conversely, determine the gamma-ray emission that escapes the ejecta without thermalizing. We identify a novel mechanism by which $\gamma$$\gamma$ pair creation in the upstream pulsar wind regulates the mean energy of particles entering the nebula over the first several years after the explosion, rendering our results on this timescale insensitive to the (uncertain) intrinsic wind pair multiplicity. To explain the observed late-time steepening of SLSN optical light curves as being the result of gamma-ray leakage, we find that the nebular magnetization must be very low, \$\{{\textbackslash}varepsilon \}\_\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{B\}\}\}{\textbackslash}lesssim \{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{-6\}{\textbackslash}mbox\{--\}\{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{-4\}\$ . For higher \$\{{\textbackslash}varepsilon \}\_\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{B\}\}\}\$ , the more efficiently thermalized lower-energy synchrotron emission would overproduce the late-time (?1 yr) optical radiation, inconsistent with observations. For magnetars to remain as viable contenders for powering SLSNe, we conclude that either magnetic dissipation in the wind/nebula is extremely efficient or the spin-down luminosity decays significantly faster than the canonical dipole rate ?t-2 in a way that coincidentally mimics gamma-ray escape.},

By "extraction", we mean not only restoration of unknown (random) signals, but also detection of signals of known form together with measurement of unknown parameters of such signals. Much attention is given to radar problems. Thus, in addition to ordinary radio noise, resembling noise in the receiver itself, we study noise due to chaotic reflections from a large number of objects randomly located in space. This means that from the very beginning, we are obliged to take into account both "white noise" and "correlated noise". This makes our treatment more general, and even simplifies it, since the mathematical analysis of "pure" white noise involves certain difficulties.},

We present a new model in which these electrons form the photoionized ``skin'' of an underlying cool, self-gravitating cloud in the Galactic halo. In this way, we avoid the severe overpressure problem that afflicts other models. The UV flux in the Galactic halo naturally generates electron densities of the right order. We demonstrate, for the first time, a good reproduction of the prototypical ESE in the quasar 0954+658. The neutral clouds are a few astronomical units in radius and have masses {\textless}{\textasciitilde}10-3 Msolar. The observed rate of ESEs implies that a large fraction of the mass of the Galaxy is in this form.},

	abstract = {Several radio-wave scintillation phenomena exhibit properties which are difficult to accommodate within the standard propagation model based on distributed Kolmogorov turbulence in the ionised ISM; here we discuss one such phenomenon, namely Extreme Scattering Events. By analysis of the data we demonstrate that these events are caused by ionised gas associated with self-gravitating, AU-sized gas clouds. The data also show that the ionised gas is confined by ram pressure, with the clouds moving at hundreds of km/s relative to the diffuse ISM and causing strong shocks. These conclusions are supported by a quantitative model in which heat from the shocked ISM evaporates gas from the surface of a cold cloud; this model readily explains the physical conditions which are required for Extreme Scattering and yields passable reproductions of the light-curves. The magnetotail of the cloud provides a site in which two other ``anomalous'' radio-wave propagation phenomena -- Intra-Day Variability of quasars, and pulsar parabolic arcs -- can plausibly arise, thus linking three anomalous propagation phenomena in a single physical model. Locally there must be thousands of these neutral clouds per cubic parsec and by mass they are the primary constituent of interstellar matter.},

The circumstellar plasma structures that we infer are similar in several respects to the cometary knots seen in the Helix and in other planetary nebulae.

The source was detected six times between 2020 January and 2020 September as part of the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder Variables and Slow Transients (ASKAP VAST) survey at 888 MHz. It exhibited a high degree ({\textasciitilde}25\%) of circular polarization when it was visible. We monitored the source with the MeerKAT telescope from 2020 November to 2021 February on a 2-4 week cadence. The source was not detected with MeerKAT before 2021 February 7 when it appeared and reached a peak flux density of 5.6 mJy. The source was still highly circularly polarized, but also showed up to 80\% linear polarization, and then faded rapidly with a timescale of one day. The rotation measure of the source varied significantly, from -11.8 {\textpm} 0.8 rad m-2 to -64.0 {\textpm} 1.5 rad m-2 over three days. No X-ray counterpart was found in follow-up Swift or Chandra observations about a week after the first MeerKAT detection, with upper limits of {\textasciitilde}5.0 {\texttimes} 1031 erg s-1 (0.3-8 keV, assuming a distance {\textasciitilde}10 kpc). No counterpart is seen in new or archival near-infrared observations down to J = 20.8 mag. We discuss possible identifications for ASKAP J173608.2-321635 including a low-mass star/substellar object with extremely low infrared luminosity, a pulsar with scatter-broadened pulses, a transient magnetar, or a Galactic Center radio transient: none of these fully explains the observations, which suggests that ASKAP J173608.2-321635 may represent part of a new class of objects being discovered through radio imaging surveys.},

	abstract = {The emerging population of long-period radio transients (LPTs) shows both similarities and differences with normal pulsars. A key difference is that their radio emission is too bright to be powered solely by rotational energy. Various models have been proposed (including both white dwarf or neutron star origins), and their nature remains uncertain. Known LPTs have minutes-to-hours-long spin periods, while normal pulsars have periods ranging from milliseconds to seconds. Here, we report the discovery of PSR J0311+1402, an object with an intermediate spin period of 41 s, bridging the gap between LPTs and normal pulsars. PSR J0311+1402 exhibits low linear (\~{}25\%) and circular polarization (\~{}5\%) and a relatively steep spectral index (\~{} -2.3), features similar to normal pulsars. However, its observed spin-down properties place it below the pulsar death line, where pair production and thus radio emission are expected to cease. The discovery of PSR J0311+1402 suggests the existence of a previously undetected population within this intermediate period range, presumably missed due to selection biases in traditional pulsar search methods. Finding more such objects is important to fill the current gap in neutron star spin periods, improving our understanding of the relationships among rotation-powered pulsars and LPTs.},

Each observation was tracked for approximately 8 - 10 h, with a typical rms sensitivity of {\textasciitilde}30 $\mu$Jy beam-1 and an angular resolution of {\textasciitilde}12 arcsec. The variability search was conducted within each 8 - 10 h observation on a 15-min time-scale. We detected 38 variable and transient sources. Seven of them are known pulsars, including an eclipsing millisecond pulsar, PSR J2039-5617. Another eight sources are stars, only one of which has been previously identified as a radio star. For the remaining 23 objects, 22 are associated with active galactic nuclei or galaxies (including the five intra-hour variables that have been reported previously), and their variations are caused by discrete, local plasma screens. The remaining source has no multiwavelength counterparts and is therefore yet to be identified. This is the first large-scale radio survey for variables and transient sources on minute time-scales at a sub-mJy sensitivity level.

Here we describe V-FASTR, an experiment to perform a blind search for fast transient radio signals using the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). The experiment runs entirely in a commensal mode, alongside normal VLBA observations and operations. It is made possible by the features and flexibility of the DiFX software correlator that is used to process VLBA data. Using the VLBA for this type of experiment offers significant advantages over single-dish experiments, including a larger field of view, the ability to easily distinguish local radio-frequency interference from real signals, and the possibility to localize detected events on the sky to milliarcsecond accuracy. We describe our software pipeline, which accepts short integration ({\textasciitilde} ms) spectrometer data from each antenna in real time during correlation and performs an incoherent dedispersion separately for each antenna, over a range of trial dispersion measures. The dedispersed data are processed by a sophisticated detector and candidate events are recorded. At the end of the correlation, small snippets of the raw data at the time of the events are stored for further analysis. We present the results of our event detection pipeline from some test observations of the pulsars B0329+54 and B0531+21 (the Crab pulsar).},

	abstract = {Study of radio supernovae over the past 20 years includes two dozen detected objects and more than 100 upper limits. From this work it is possible to identify classes of radio properties, demonstrate conformance to and deviations from existing models, estimate the density and structure of the circumstellar material and, by inference, the evolution of the presupernova stellar wind, and reveal the last stages of stellar evolution before explosion. It is also possible to detect ionized hydrogen along the line of sight, to demonstrate binary properties of the stellar system, and to show clumpiness of the circumstellar material. More speculatively, it may be possible to provide distance estimates to radio supernovae. Over the past four years the afterglow of gamma-ray bursters has occasionally been detected in the radio, as well in other wavelengths bands. In particular, the interesting and unusual gamma-ray burst GRB980425, thought to be related to SN1998bw, is a possible link between supernovae and gamma-ray bursters. Analyzing the extensive radio emission data avaliable for SN1998bw, one can describe its time evolution within the well-established framework available for the analysis of radio emission from supernovae. This allows relatively detailed description of a number of physical properties of the object. The radio emission can best be explained as the interaction of a mildly relativistic ($\Lambda$ {\textasciitilde} 1.6) shock with a dense preexplosion stellar wind-established circumstellar medium that is highly structured both azimuthally, in clumps or filaments, and radially, with observed density enhancements. Because of its unusual characteristics for a Type Ib/c supernova, the relation of SN1998bw to GRB980425 is strengthened and suggests that at least some classes of GRBs originate in massive star explosions. Thus, employing the formalism for describing the radio emission from supernovae and following the link through SN1998bw/GRB980425, it is possible to model the gross properties of the radio and optical/infrared emission from the half-dozen GRBs with extensive radio observations. From this we conclude that at least some members of the "slow-soft" class of GRBs can be attributed to the explosion of a massive star in a dense, highly structured circumstellar medium that was presumably established by the preexplosion stellar system.},

	abstract = {The importance of shocks in nova explosions has been highlighted by Fermi's discovery of $\gamma$-ray-producing novae. Over three years of multiband Very Large Array radio observations of the 2010 nova V1723 Aql show that shocks between fast and slow flows within the ejecta led to the acceleration of particles and the production of synchrotron radiation. Soon after the start of the eruption, shocks in the ejecta produced an unexpected radio flare, resulting in a multipeaked radio light curve. The emission eventually became consistent with an expanding thermal remnant with mass 2 {\texttimes} 10-4 M? and temperature 104 K. However, during the first two months, the ?106 K brightness temperature at low frequencies was too high to be due to thermal emission from the small amount of X-ray-producing shock-heated gas. Radio imaging showed structures with velocities of 400 km s-1 (d/6 kpc) in the plane of the sky, perpendicular to a more elongated 1500 km s-1 (d/6 kpc) flow. The morpho-kinematic structure of the ejecta from V1723 Aql appears similar to nova V959 Mon, where collisions between a slow torus and a faster flow collimated the fast flow and gave rise to $\gamma$-ray-producing shocks. Optical spectroscopy and X-ray observations of V1723 Aql during the radio flare are consistent with this picture. Our observations support the idea that shocks in novae occur when a fast flow collides with a slow collimating torus. Such shocks could be responsible for hard X-ray emission, $\gamma$-ray production, and double-peaked radio light curves from some classical novae.},

	abstract = {Since the Fermi discovery of $\gamma$-rays from novae, one of the biggest questions in the field has been how novae generate such high-energy emission. Shocks must be a fundamental ingredient. Six months of radio observations of the 2012 Nova V5589 Sgr with the VLA and 15 weeks of X-ray observations with Swift/XRT show that the radio emission consisted of: (1) a shock-powered, non-thermal flare; and (2) weak thermal emission from 10-5 M? of freely expanding, photoionized ejecta. Absorption features in the optical spectrum and the peak optical brightness suggest that V5589 Sgr lies 4 kpc away (3.2-4.6 kpc). The shock-powered flare dominated the radio light curve at low frequencies before day 100. The spectral evolution of the radio flare, its high radio brightness temperature, the presence of unusually hard (kTx {\textgreater} 33 keV) X-rays, and the ratio of radio to X-ray flux near radio maximum all support the conclusions that the flare was shock-powered and non-thermal. Unlike most other novae with strong shock-powered radio emission, V5589 Sgr is not embedded in the wind of a red-giant companion. Based on the similar inclinations and optical line profiles of V5589 Sgr and V959 Mon, we propose that shocks in V5589 Sgr formed from collisions between a slow flow with an equatorial density enhancement and a subsequent faster flow. We speculate that the relatively high speed and low mass of the ejecta led to the unusual radio emission from V5589 Sgr, and perhaps also to the non-detection of $\gamma$-rays.},

They are transient phenomena with respect to the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty Centimeters survey and constitute the first unbiased sample of renewed radio activity. Here we present a follow-up, radio, optical, and X-ray study of them. The group consists of 12 sources, both quasars and galaxies with wide redshift (0.04 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.7) and luminosity ( \$22 \{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{log\}\}\_\{10\}[\{L\}\_\{1.4{\textbackslash}mathrm\{GHz\}\}/\{{\textbackslash}rm\{W\}\}{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Hz\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}] 24.5\$ ) distributions. Their radio properties in the first phase of activity, namely the convex spectra and compact morphology, allow them all to be classified as gigahertz-peaked spectrum (GPS) sources. We conclude that the spectral changes are a consequence of the evolution of newly born radio jets. Our observations show that over the next few years of activity the GPS galaxies keep the convex shape of the spectrum, while GPS quasars rapidly transform into flat-spectrum sources, which may result in them not being recognized as young sources. The wide range of bolometric luminosities, black hole masses, and jet powers among the transient sources indicates even greater population diversity in the group of young radio objects. We also suggest that small changes of the accretion disk luminosity (accretion rate) may be sufficient to ignite low-power radio activity that evolves on the scale of decades.},

However, a growing number of observations of low power radio sources suggests that the model cannot explain all their properties and there are still some aspects of the evolutionary path that remain unclear. There are indications\vphantom{\{}\}, that some sources may be short-lived objects on timescales of 10{\textasciicircum}4 - 10{\textasciicircum}5 years.

Using the 305-m Arecibo radiotelescope to make precise timing measurements of pulses from the recently discovered 6.2-ms pulsar PSR1257 +12 (ref. 2), we demonstrate that, rather than being associated with a stellar object, the pulsar is orbited by two or more planet-sized bodies. The planets detected so far have masses of at least 2.8 M(+) and 3.4 M(+) where M(+) is the mass of the Earth. Their respective distances from the pulsar are 0.47 AU and 0.36 AU, and they move in almost circular orbits with periods of 98.2 and 66.6 days. Observations indicate that at least one more planet may be present in this system. The detection of a planetary system around a nearby ({\textasciitilde}500 pc), old neutron star, together with the recent report on a planetary companion to the pulsar PSR1829-10 (ref. 3) raises the tantalizing possibility that a non-negligible fraction of neutron stars observable as radio pulsars may be orbited by planet-like bodies.},

The kinetic energy and luminosity of well-studied GRB-SNe appear to be greater than those of ordinary SNe, but evidence exists, even in a limited sample, for considerable diversity. The existing sample also suggests that most of the energy in the explosion is contained in nonrelativistic ejecta (producing the supernova) rather than in the relativistic jets responsible for making the burst and its afterglow. Neither all SNe, nor even all SNe of Type Ibc produce GRBs. The degree of differential rotation in the collapsing iron core of massive stars when they die may be what makes the difference.},

	abstract = {Pulsar{\textendash}black hole (BH) close binary systems, which have not been found yet, are unique laboratories for testing theories of gravity and understanding the formation channels of gravitational-wave sources. We study the self-gravitational lensing effect in a pulsar{\textendash}BH system on the pulsar's emission. Because this effect occurs once per orbital period for almost edge-on binaries, we find that it could generate apparently ultralong period (minutes to hours) radio signals when the intrinsic pulsar signal is too weak to detect. Each of such lensed signals, or "pulse," is composed of a number of amplified intrinsic pulsar pulses. We estimate that a radio telescope with a sensitivity of 10 mJy could detect a few systems that emit such signals in our Galaxy. The model is applied to three recently found puzzling long-period radio sources: GLEAM-X J1627, PSR J0901-4046, and GPM J1839-10. To explain their observed signal durations and periods, the masses of their lensing components are estimated as \~{}104 M ?, \~{}4 M ?, and 103-6 M ?, respectively, with their binary coalescence times ranging from a few tens to thousands of years. However, the implied merger rates (as high as \~{}103-4 Myr-1 per galaxy) and the large period decay rates ({\textgreater}10-8 s s-1) tend to disfavor this self-lensing scenario for these three sources. Despite this, our work still provides observational characteristics for self-lensed pulsar{\textendash}BH binaries, which could help the detection of related sources in the future. Finally, for a binary containing a millisecond pulsar and a stellar-mass BH, the Shapiro delay effect would cause a >=10\% variation of the profile width for the subpulses in such lensed signals.},

Multiwavelength and polarization observations of an FRB source would be helpful to diagnose its progenitor and environment. So far only the first repeating source FRB 121102 appears to be spatially coincident with a persistent radio emission. Its bursts also have very large values of the Faraday rotation measure (RM), I.e., \${\textbar} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{RM\}{\textbar} {\textbackslash}sim \{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{5\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{rad\}{\textbackslash},\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{m\}\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$ . We show that theoretically there should be a simple relation between RM and the luminosity of the persistent source of an FRB source if the observed RM mostly arises from the persistent emission region. FRB 121102 follows this relation given that the magnetic field in the persistent emission region is highly ordered and that the number of relativistic electrons powering the persistent emission is comparable to that of nonrelativistic electrons that contribute to RM.

	abstract = {We present a new model for the distribution of free electrons in the Galaxy, the Magellanic Clouds, and the intergalactic medium (IGM) that can be used to estimate distances to real or simulated pulsars and fast radio bursts (FRBs) based on their dispersion measure (DM). The Galactic model has an extended thick disk representing the so-called warm interstellar medium, a thin disk representing the Galactic molecular ring, spiral arms based on a recent fit to Galactic H II regions, a Galactic Center disk, and seven local features including the Gum Nebula, Galactic Loop I, and the Local Bubble. An offset of the Sun from the Galactic plane and a warp of the outer Galactic disk are included in the model. Parameters of the Galactic model are determined by fitting to 189 pulsars with independently determined distances and DMs. Simple models are used for the Magellanic Clouds and the IGM. Galactic model distances are within the uncertainty range for 86 of the 189 independently determined distances and within 20\% of the nearest limit for a further 38 pulsars. We estimate that 95\% of predicted Galactic pulsar distances will have a relative error of less than a factor of 0.9. The predictions of YMW16 are compared to those of the TC93 and NE2001 models showing that YMW16 performs significantly better on all measures. Timescales for pulse broadening due to interstellar scattering are estimated for (real or simulated) Galactic and Magellanic Cloud pulsars and FRBs.},

	abstract = {We review both observational and theoretical aspects of the generation of auroral radio emissions at the outer planets, trying to organize the former in a coherent frame set by the latter. Important results have been obtained in the past few years on these radio emissions at the five magnetized planets, from the observations of Ulysses at Jupiter and of Wind and other Global Geospace Science spacecraft in Earth orbit, from the reanalysis of Voyager data about Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, from ground-based high frequency-time resolution and full polarization measurements, and from pioneering multispectral observations of the Jovian and Saturnian aurorae (radio/UV/IR). In parallel, considerable progress has been made in their generation theory (Cyclotron-Maser operating in small-scale, laminar, hot-plasma-dominated radio source structures), mostly on the basis of in situ observations of terrestrial radio sources. Particle acceleration and precipitation is also better documented, thanks to in situ measurements in the Earth auroral zones and to multispectral studies of Jupiter and Saturn. Finally, the modeling of the planetary magnetic field and magnetospheric plasma at these two planets has also been considerably improved. To organize the wealth of observational results within a coherent theoretical frame, we emphasize unresolved questions (e.g., planetary radio bursts generation) and contradictions and propose ways to answer them. Our ability, already significant, to perform remote sensing of magnetoplasmas at the giant planets and, hopefully, at other distant radio sources (solar, stellar) in the near future, depends on the good understanding of the physical processes underlying the generation of auroral electromagnetic emissions. The question of the existence of exoplanetary radio emissions and the possibility to detect and study them is briefly discussed.},

	abstract = {Active galactic nuclei, which are powered by long-term accretion onto central supermassive black holes, produce relativistic jets with lifetimes of at least one million years, and the observation of the birth of such a jet is therefore unlikely. Transient accretion onto a supermassive black hole, for example through the tidal disruption of a stray star, thus offers a rare opportunity to study the birth of a relativistic jet. On 25 March 2011, an unusual transient source (Swift J164449.3+573451) was found, potentially representing such an accretion event. Here we report observations spanning centimetre to millimetre wavelengths and covering the first month of evolution of a luminous radio transient associated with Swift J164449.3+573451. The radio transient coincides with the nucleus of an inactive galaxy. We conclude that we are seeing a newly formed relativistic outflow, launched by transient accretion onto a million-solar-mass black hole. A relativistic outflow is not predicted in this situation, but we show that the tidal disruption of a star naturally explains the observed high-energy properties and radio luminosity and the inferred rate of such events. The weaker beaming in the radio-frequency spectrum relative to $\gamma$-rays or X-rays suggests that radio searches may uncover similar events out to redshifts of z{\textasciitilde}6.},

	abstract = {We present continued multi-frequency radio observations of the relativistic tidal disruption event Swift J164449.3+573451 (Sw 1644+57) extending to t ? 600 days. The data were obtained with the JVLA and AMI Large Array as part of our on-going study of the jet energetics and the density structure of the parsec-scale environment around the disrupting supermassive black hole. We combine these data with public Swift/XRT and Chandra X-ray observations over the same time-frame to show that the jet has undergone a dramatic transition starting at ?500 days, with a sharp decline in the X-ray flux by about a factor of 170 on a timescale of $\delta$t/t {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 0.2 (and by a factor of 15 in $\delta$t/t ? 0.05). The rapid decline rules out a forward shock origin (direct or reprocessing) for the X-ray emission at {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 500 days, and instead points to internal dissipation in the inner jet. On the other hand, our radio data uniquely demonstrate that the low X-ray flux measured by Chandra at ?610 days is consistent with emission from the forward shock. Furthermore, the Chandra data are inconsistent with thermal emission from the accretion disk itself since the expected temperature of {\textasciitilde}30-60 eV and inner radius of {\textasciitilde}2-10 Rs cannot accommodate the observed flux level or the detected emission at {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 1 keV. We associate the rapid decline with a turn off of the relativistic jet when the mass accretion rate dropped below \~{}{\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\_Edd ? 0.006 M ? yr-1 (for a 3 {\texttimes} 106 M ? black hole and order unity efficiency) indicating that the peak accretion rate was about 330 {\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\_Edd, and the total accreted mass by t ? 500 days is about 0.15 M ?. From the radio data we further find significant flattening in the integrated energy of the forward shock at t {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 250 days with E j, iso ? 2 {\texttimes} 1054 erg (Ej ? 1052 erg for a jet opening angle, $\theta$ j = 0.1) following a rise by about a factor of 15 at ?30-250 days.

The typical errors are between 0.01 and 0.03 mag for most colors. We derived the empirical reddening coefficients for 21 colors both in the traditional (single-valued) way and as a function of T eff and E(B - V) by using the largest samples of accurate reddening measurements, together with the extinction values from Schlegel et al. The corresponding extinction coefficients have also been obtained. The results are compared with model predictions and generally in good agreement. Comparisons with measurements in the literature show that the T eff- and E(B - V)-dependent coefficients explain the discrepancies between different measurements naturally, i.e., using sample stars of different temperatures and reddening. Our coefficients are mostly valid in the extinction range of 0-0.5 mag and the temperature range of 4000-10,000 K. We recommend that the new T eff- and E(B - V)-dependent reddening and extinction coefficients should be used in the future.

The bursting epoch corresponds to the episodes in which stronger sunspot-like magnetic fields emerge into the white dwarf polar cap region during which the pair-production condition is satisfied and the white dwarf behaves like a radio pulsar.

Two generic categories of radiation model invoking either magnetospheres of compact objects (neutron stars or black holes) or relativistic shocks launched from such objects have been much debated. The recent detection of a Galactic fast radio burst in association with a soft gamma-ray repeater suggests that magnetar engines can produce at least some, and probably all, fast radio bursts. Other engines that could produce fast radio bursts are not required, but are also not impossible.},

The rapid accumulation of observational data has painted the following sketch about the physical origin of FRBs: They predominantly originate from cosmological distances, so their sources produce the most extreme coherent radio emission in the Universe; at least some, probably most, FRBs are repeating sources that do not invoke cataclysmic events; and at least some FRBs are produced by magnetars, neutron stars with the strongest magnetic fields in the Universe. Many open questions regarding the physical origin(s) and mechanism(s) of FRBs remain. This review addresses the phenomenology and possible underlying physics of FRBs. Topics include a summary of the observational data, basic plasma physics, general constraints on FRB models from the data, radiation mechanisms, source and environment models, and propagation effects, as well as FRBs as cosmological probes.

	abstract = {Among more than 800 known fast radio bursts (FRBs), only two, namely FRB 20121102A and FRB 20190520B, are confirmed to be associated with persistent radio sources (PRSs). Here, we report evidence of apparent temporal variability in the PRS associated with the bursting FRB 20190520B based on Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array observations taken in 2020 and 2021. Based on the analysis of the epoch-to-epoch variability of the PRS at the L, S, C, and X bands (1-12 GHz), we detected not only overall marginal variability, but also a likely radio flux decrease ($\sigma$ {\textasciitilde} 3.2) between the observations taken in 2020 and 2021 at 3 GHz. Assuming no spectral variation in the PRS during these observations, we found evidence for an overall broadband radio flux decrease by about 20\% between the 2020 and the 2021 observations, suggesting that the PRS probably evolves on a yearly timescale. If we attribute the marginal variability at 3 GHz as intrinsic or due to scintillation, the size of the potential variable component of the PRS is constrained to be subparsec. On the other hand, the size of the PRS can be also constrained to ?0.22 pc from the time-averaged radio spectrum and the integrated radio luminosity in the 1-12 GHz band, based on equipartition and self-absorption arguments. We discuss the potential origins of the PRS and suggest that an accreting compact object origin might be able to explain the PRS's temporal and spectral properties. Confirmation of the variability or flux decline of the PRS will be critical for our understanding of the PRS and its relation to the bursting source.},

These galaxies are not detected or are weakly detected in the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty cm survey, performed from 1993-2009, but have brightened significantly in radio flux (by a factor of ?5) in the epoch I (2017-2019) observations of the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS). All 18 galaxies have been detected in VLASS epoch II observations, from 2020-2021, from which the radio flux has been found to evolve slowly (with variability amplitudes of ?40\%) over a period of about 3 yr. 15 galaxies have been observed in the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey, and a flat or inverted spectral slope between 888 MHz and 3 GHz is found. Based on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectra taken before the radio brightening, 14 of the 18 galaxies can be classified as LINERs or normal galaxies with weak or no nuclear activity. Most galaxies are red and massive, with more than half having central black hole masses above 108M?. We find that only one galaxy in our sample displays an optical flare lasting for at least two months, with a long decay in the infrared light curve that can be explained as the dust-heated echo emission of a central optical flare, such as a stellar tidal disruption event. We discuss several possibilities for the transient radio emission and conclude that it is likely associated with a newborn radio jet triggered by short sporadic fueling of a supermassive black hole. Such a scenario can be tested with further multifrequency radio observations of these sources, via measuring their radio flux variability and spectral evolution.},

Our method exhibited superior performance, achieving F-scores of 0.969 and 0.936 for the detection of small bursts with low peak count rates such as structured bursts and microbursts, respectively. Then, based on Rossi X-ray Timing Detector observation data for GRO J1744-28 during the outburst period, we identified low-amplitude bursts using the proposed method and analyzed the burst regularity of GRO J1744-28. Our approach does not require complex modeling and has powerful feature extraction and detection capabilities, which can be used to automatically and efficiently detect changes in a data stream.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the influence of different braking mechanisms on the formation of three long-period radio pulsars (PSRs J0250+5854, J2251-3711, and J0901-4046): plasma-filled magnetosphere in combination with magnetic field decay, fall-back disc, and r-mode instability. These braking mechanisms can also affect the thermal evolution of pulsars. By comparing the model-predicted values with observational data such as spin periods, period derivatives, and upper limits of the bolometric luminosity of these pulsars, we find that these three braking mechanisms can reasonably explain the spin period and the period derivative within a certain range of parameters for these sources. The model-predicted bolometric luminosity associated with magnetic field dissipation exceeds the upper limit for PSR J0901-4046 but falls below the upper limits for PSR J0250+5854 and PSR J2251-3711. The model-predicted bolometric luminosity within the fall-back disc model exceeds the observed results, whereas the luminosity within the r-mode instability falls below the observed upper limit for these three pulsars. However, a conflict arises when we consider the pulsar radio activity and the accretion phases within the fall-back disc model simultaneously. By combining data from radio and X-ray observations, along with precise measurements of surface thermal emissions, we can enhance our understanding of the braking mechanisms involved in the formation of long-period radio pulsars or constrain key model parameters. Finding more long-period pulsars in the future and conducting multiband observations will enhance our understanding of the formation and nature of long-period radio pulsars.},

	abstract = {In extreme scattering events, the brightness of a compact radio source drops significantly, as light is refracted out of the line of sight by foreground plasma lenses. Despite recent efforts, the nature of these lenses has remained a puzzle, because any roughly round lens would be so highly overpressurized relative to the interstellar medium that it could only exist for about a year. This, combined with a lack of constraints on distances and velocities, has led to a plethora of theoretical models. We present observations of a dramatic double-lensing event in pulsar PSR B0834+06 and use a novel phase-retrieval technique to show that the data can be reproduced remarkably well with a two-screen model: one screen with many small lenses and another with a single, strong one. We further show that the latter lens is so strong that it would inevitably cause extreme scattering events. Our observations show that the lens moves slowly and is highly elongated on the sky. If similarly elongated along the line of sight, as would arise naturally from a sheet of plasma viewed nearly edge-on, no large overpressure is required and hence the lens could be long-lived.},

We present Australian Square Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) observations of UV Ceti at a central frequency of 888 MHz. We detect several periodic, coherent pulses occurring over a time-scale consistent with the rotational period of UV Ceti. The properties of the pulsed emission show that they originate from the electron cyclotron maser instability, in a cavity at least 7 orders of magnitude less dense than the mean coronal density at the estimated source altitude. These results confirm that auroral activity can occur in active M dwarfs, suggesting that these stars mark the beginning of the transition from solar-like to auroral magnetospheric behaviour. These results demonstrate the capabilities of ASKAP for detecting polarized, coherent bursts from active stars and other systems.},

	abstract = {Large widefield surveys make possible the serendipitous discovery of rare subclasses of pulsars. One such class are 'spider'-type pulsar binaries, comprised of a pulsar in a compact orbit with a low-mass (sub)stellar companion. In a search for circularly polarized radio sources in Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) Pilot Survey observations, we discovered highly variable and circularly polarized emission from a radio source within the error region of the $\gamma$-ray source 4FGL J1646.5-4406. The variability is consistent with the eclipse of a compact, steep-spectrum source behind ablated material from a companion in an {\textasciitilde}5.3 h binary orbit. Based on the eclipse properties and spatial coincidence with 4FGL J1646.5-4406, we argue that the source is likely a recycled pulsar in a 'redback' binary system. Using properties of the eclipses from ASKAP and Murchison Widefield Array observations, we provide broad constraints on the properties of the eclipse medium. We identified a potential optical/infrared counterpart in archival data consistent with a variable low-mass star. Using the Parkes radio telescope 'Murriyang' and the Meer Karoo Array Telescope (MeerKAT) , we searched extensively for radio pulsations but yielded no viable detections of pulsed emission. We suggest that the non-detection of pulses is due to scattering in the intra-binary material, but scattering from the interstellar medium can also plausibly explain the pulse non-detections if the interstellar dispersion measure exceeds {\textasciitilde}600 pc cm-3. Orbital constraints derived from optical observations of the counterpart would be highly valuable for future $\gamma$-ray pulsation searches, which may confirm the source nature as a pulsar.},

Similar low-frequency bursts detected from active M-dwarfs are expected to probe their space weather environments and therefore the habitability of their planetary companions. Active M-dwarfs produce frequent, powerful flares which, along with radio emission, reveal conditions within their atmospheres. However, to date, only one candidate solar-like coherent radio burst has been identified from these stars, preventing robust observational constraints on their space weather environment. During simultaneous optical and radio monitoring of the nearby dM5.5e star Proxima Centauri, we detected a bright, long-duration optical flare, accompanied by a series of intense, coherent radio bursts. These detections include the first example of an interferometrically detected coherent stellar radio burst temporally coincident with a flare, strongly indicating a causal relationship between these transient events. The polarization and temporal structure of the trailing long-duration burst enable us to identify it as a type IV burst. This represents the most compelling detection of a solar-like radio burst from another star to date. Solar type IV bursts are strongly associated with space weather events such as coronal mass ejections and solar energetic particle events, suggesting that stellar type IV bursts may be used as a tracer of stellar coronal mass ejections. We discuss the implications of this event for the occurrence of coronal mass ejections from Proxima Cen and other active M-dwarfs.},
