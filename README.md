# Transient_Comparison_Plots
This repository contains curated datasets and plotting scripts used to explore the radio luminosity, temporal evolution, and energy–velocity phase space of astrophysical transients. The sources include GRBs, TDEs, SNe, FBOTs, CL-AGN, and other rare classes, alongside our new source ASKAP J0055–2558.
